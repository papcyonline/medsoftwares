The 340B Drug Pricing Program generates billions in savings for covered entities, but regulatory complexity and compliance requirements demand sophisticated software solutions. In 2026, automation and AI-driven 340B management platforms are transforming from aspirational to operationally necessary, with 100% automated audit coverage becoming the standard. This comprehensive guide covers 340B program software, compliance requirements, leading platforms, implementation strategies, and maximizing savings while maintaining HRSA audit readiness.

## Understanding the 340B Drug Pricing Program

The 340B Drug Pricing Program was created in 1992 to enable covered entities serving vulnerable patient populations to stretch scarce federal resources by accessing deeply discounted outpatient drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers.

### Program Size and Growth

**2026 Market Dynamics:**
- **Covered Entities:** 14,000+ hospitals, clinics, and healthcare organizations
- **Contract Pharmacies:** 30,000+ pharmacy locations participating
- **Annual Savings:** Over $60 billion in aggregate drug discounts
- **Market Pressure:** Increased scrutiny from manufacturers, payers, and regulators

### Covered Entity Types

**Eligible Organizations:**
- Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
- Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees
- Tuberculosis clinics
- Hemophilia treatment centers
- Sexually transmitted disease clinics
- Family planning clinics (Title X)
- Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH)
- Critical Access Hospitals
- Rural Referral Centers
- Sole Community Hospitals
- Children's hospitals
- Cancer hospitals

### How 340B Works

**Basic Mechanism:**
1. Covered entities purchase medications from manufacturers at 340B ceiling prices (typically 20-50% below wholesale)
2. Entities dispense medications to eligible patients
3. Entities bill insurance/Medicare/Medicaid at regular rates
4. Savings (spread between 340B cost and reimbursement) fund patient programs and services

**Contract Pharmacy Model:**
- Covered entities contract with retail/specialty pharmacies
- Pharmacies dispense 340B medications on behalf of covered entities
- Virtual inventory model or split-billing arrangements
- Software ensures proper claims identification and processing

## 2026 Regulatory and Compliance Landscape

### HRSA Audit and Enforcement Trends

**Increased Scrutiny:**
- HRSA conducting more frequent covered entity audits
- Average audit findings requiring corrective action: 85% of audited entities
- Common violations: Patient eligibility errors, duplicate discounts, diversion
- Financial liability: Repayment of unlawful discounts plus potential fines

**Program Integrity Initiatives:**
- Enhanced data collection and reporting requirements
- Manufacturer compliance programs and data requests
- Expanded use of 340B ESP (Electronic System for Program Integrity)
- Increased coordination with state Medicaid agencies

### Regulatory Changes and Proposals

**2026 Developments:**

**HRSA Rebate Model Pilot:**
- Phased implementation beginning 2026
- Covered entities purchase drugs at market rates initially
- Claim rebates from manufacturers after dispensing
- Requires significant software system modifications

**Manufacturer Restrictions:**
- Ongoing litigation over contract pharmacy limitations
- Some manufacturers restricting 340B pricing to single contract pharmacy
- Software must track manufacturer-specific policies

**Medicaid Exclusion File Compliance:**
- Prevention of Medicaid duplicate discounts
- Daily updates to exclusion files
- Automated claims processing rules
- State-specific carve-in/carve-out policies
