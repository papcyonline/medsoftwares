The 340B Drug Pricing Program provides significant savings for covered entities, but with those savings comes strict compliance requirements. Pharmacy software plays a critical role in maintaining 340B compliance and maximizing program benefits.

## Understanding the 340B Program

The 340B program requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs at significantly reduced prices to eligible healthcare organizations (covered entities).

### Who Qualifies as a 340B Covered Entity?

- Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
- Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees
- Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH)
- Children's hospitals
- Critical Access Hospitals
- Sole Community Hospitals
- Rural Referral Centers
- Free-standing cancer hospitals

### 340B Savings Potential

| Drug Category | Typical 340B Discount |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Brand Name Drugs | 25-50% off AWP |
| Specialty Drugs | 30-60% off AWP |
| Generic Drugs | 15-30% off AWP |

## Critical 340B Compliance Requirements

### 1. Patient Eligibility

A 340B-eligible prescription requires:

- Patient is registered at the covered entity
- Prescriber is employed/contracted by the covered entity
- Drug is for outpatient use
- Prescription is related to covered entity visit

### 2. Prohibition on Duplicate Discounts

The same drug cannot receive both:
- 340B pricing AND Medicaid rebate
- Must have systems to prevent duplicate discounts

### 3. Prohibition on Diversion

340B drugs must only be dispensed to eligible patients at the covered entity or its contract pharmacy.

### 4. Audit Requirements

Covered entities must maintain records for:
- Patient eligibility verification
- Prescription-to-dispense tracking
- Inventory separation (physical or virtual)
- Manufacturer compliance

## Essential 340B Software Features

### 1. Split Billing Capabilities

Split billing is crucial for 340B compliance:

**Virtual Inventory Model:**
- Single physical inventory
- Software tracks 340B vs. non-340B accumulator
- Replenishment triggers based on 340B dispensing

**Physical Inventory Model:**
- Separate 340B and non-340B stock
- Software tracks which inventory is used
- Requires more space but cleaner separation

**Key Software Requirements:**
- Real-time accumulator tracking
- Replenishment order generation
- Inventory reconciliation reports
- Audit trail for all transactions

### 2. Patient Eligibility Verification

Software should verify eligibility at point of sale:

- Patient registration status at covered entity
- Prescriber affiliation verification
- Relationship between Rx and CE visit
- Real-time eligibility decision

**Integration Points:**
- EMR/EHR integration for patient data
- Prescriber database synchronization
- Visit history verification
- Insurance carve-out identification

### 3. Contract Pharmacy Management

For contract pharmacy arrangements:

- Covered entity data integration
- Third-party administrator (TPA) connectivity
- Claims submission to 340B TPA
- Reconciliation reporting

### 4. Medicaid Carve-Out/Carve-In

Prevent duplicate discount violations:

**Carve-Out States:**
- Dispense 340B drugs to Medicaid patients
- Bill Medicaid, no manufacturer rebate claimed
- Track carve-out claims separately

**Carve-In States:**
- Do NOT use 340B for Medicaid patients
- Bill Medicaid, manufacturer claims rebate
- Software must prevent 340B dispensing

### 5. Audit Trail and Documentation

Comprehensive record-keeping:

- Every 340B determination recorded
- Eligibility verification documented
- Prescription-to-dispense chain maintained
- Exception handling logged
- Adjustment documentation

## Preparing for 340B Audits

### HRSA Audit Focus Areas

Audits typically examine:

1. **Eligibility**: Are patients actually eligible?
2. **Diversion**: Are drugs staying within the program?
3. **Duplicate Discounts**: Any Medicaid violations?
4. **GPO Prohibition**: Are you following hospital rules?
5. **Orphan Drug Rules**: Correct for SCH/RRC/CAH?

### Software Audit Support

Your software should provide:

- Patient eligibility reports
- Prescription-to-dispense audit trails
- Accumulator reconciliation reports
- Medicaid claims carve-out reports
- Exception documentation

### Audit-Ready Checklist

## Common 340B Compliance Pitfalls

### 1. Eligibility Creep

**Problem**: Dispensing 340B drugs to ineligible patients
**Solution**: Rigorous eligibility verification at point of sale

### 2. Inadequate Documentation

**Problem**: Can't prove compliance during audit
**Solution**: Comprehensive software audit trails

### 3. Accumulator Mismatch
