Hospital management software doesn't have to cost millions. While vendors like Epic and Cerner dominate the large hospital market with enterprise pricing, many affordable alternatives offer comparable functionality for small to medium hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities worldwide.

      ## Why Hospital Software Pricing Varies So Dramatically

      Hospital software costs range from under $1,000 to over $5 million. Here's why:

      
        - **Target Market:** Enterprise vendors target large health systems
        - **Sales Model:** Large sales teams and long cycles add costs
        - **Implementation:** Complex customization drives up prices
        - **Support Model:** Dedicated account teams for enterprise
        - **Feature Bloat:** Features most hospitals never use
