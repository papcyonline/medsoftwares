## Architecture and Technical Complexity

### Bahmni Architecture

Bahmni's greatest strength is also its biggest challenge: it is a composite system built from multiple independent open-source projects. A typical Bahmni installation involves:

- **OpenMRS**: Java/Tomcat application with MySQL database
- **OpenELIS**: Separate Java application with its own database
- **Odoo/ERPNext**: Python application with PostgreSQL database
- **dcm4chee**: Java-based DICOM server
- **Bahmni Connect**: Offline Android application
- **Multiple databases**: At least 3 separate databases to maintain
- **Integration layer**: Custom middleware connecting all components

This architecture means your IT team needs expertise across Java, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, and potentially Docker/Ansible for deployment automation. When something breaks, diagnosing which component caused the failure requires deep knowledge of the entire stack.

### HospitalOS Architecture

HospitalOS uses a single, unified codebase with one database. All modules -- EMR, pharmacy, billing, lab, radiology, inventory, and HR -- share a common data layer. This means:

- **Single application** to install, update, and maintain
- **One database** for all hospital data
- **Consistent interface** across all modules
- **No integration issues** between components
- **Simpler backup and disaster recovery**

## Deployment and Setup

### Bahmni Deployment

Bahmni provides Docker-based and Ansible-based deployment tools, which simplify initial installation compared to setting up each component manually. However, a production deployment still requires:

- **DevOps expertise**: Familiarity with Docker, Linux system administration, and networking
- **Hardware planning**: Multiple services require adequate RAM (minimum 8GB recommended, 16GB preferred)
- **Configuration**: Each component (OpenMRS, OpenELIS, Odoo) needs separate configuration
- **Customization**: Form design in OpenMRS, billing configuration in Odoo, lab tests in OpenELIS
- **Timeline**: 2-6 months for a production-ready deployment
- **Ongoing maintenance**: Regular updates across all components, database maintenance, log management

### HospitalOS Deployment

- **Professional installation**: MedSoftwares team handles full setup
- **Pre-configured**: Modules configured for your facility's workflow
- **Training included**: Staff training as part of deployment
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for full deployment
- **Minimal IT requirements**: No DevOps expertise needed on staff

## FAQ

### Can Bahmni work offline like HospitalOS?

Bahmni offers offline data collection through Bahmni Connect, an Android application that allows clinical data entry without internet connectivity. However, this is limited to specific forms and workflows. HospitalOS provides full offline functionality across all modules -- EMR, pharmacy, billing, laboratory, and inventory -- with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored. The difference is between partial offline capability and a true offline-first architecture.

### Is Bahmni easier to set up than OpenMRS alone?

Yes, significantly. Bahmni provides Docker-based deployment and a unified interface that saves months of integration work compared to assembling OpenMRS, lab, and billing systems independently. However, it is still considerably more complex to deploy and maintain than a commercial solution like HospitalOS, which requires no DevOps expertise from the hospital's staff.

### How does data migrate between Bahmni and HospitalOS?

MedSoftwares provides assisted data migration services for facilities moving from Bahmni or any other HMS to HospitalOS. Since Bahmni uses OpenMRS as its clinical backbone, patient records stored in the OpenMRS concept dictionary can be mapped and transferred. The migration team handles data validation and integrity checks to ensure no clinical data is lost during the transition.

### Which system has better reporting capabilities?

Both systems offer reporting, but through different approaches. Bahmni combines OpenMRS reporting with Odoo analytics, which can be powerful but requires knowledge of both systems. HospitalOS provides unified reporting dashboards that pull data from all modules -- clinical, financial, pharmacy, and inventory -- into a single analytics interface. For administrators who need a consolidated view of hospital operations, HospitalOS reporting is more intuitive and comprehensive.

### Can HospitalOS handle the same clinical complexity as Bahmni?

Yes. While Bahmni's OpenMRS foundation offers a highly flexible concept dictionary popular in research settings, HospitalOS supports ICD-10 coding, clinical protocols, drug interaction checks, and standard medical documentation required for day-to-day hospital operations. For facilities focused on patient care delivery rather than clinical research, HospitalOS provides all necessary clinical functionality with less setup complexity.
