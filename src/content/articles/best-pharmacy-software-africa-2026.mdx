## Essential Features for African Pharmacies

### 1. Offline Operation

**Non-negotiable for Africa.**

Your pharmacy can't stop because the internet is down. PharmaPOS stores all data locally and syncs when connectivity returns.

### 2. Mobile Money

**How most customers want to pay.**

| Payment Method | % of Transactions |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Mobile money | 40-60% |
| Cash | 30-40% |
| Card | 5-15% |
| Insurance | 10-20% |

Software without mobile money leaves money on the table.

### 3. Insurance Integration

**National health insurance is growing.**

- Kenya: NHIF covers 20M+ Kenyans
- Nigeria: NHIS expanding coverage
- Ghana: NHIS is mandatory
- Others: Expanding rapidly

Software must handle insurance claims efficiently.

### 4. Expiration Management

**Critical for African climate.**

Hot conditions accelerate medication degradation. Your software must:
- Track expiration dates
- Alert before expiry
- Manage FEFO (First Expired, First Out)
- Report on near-expiry stock

### 5. Low Hardware Requirements

**Runs on available equipment.**

Not every pharmacy has new computers. Software should work on:
- Older Windows PCs
- Basic specifications
- Standard printers
- Simple barcode scanners
