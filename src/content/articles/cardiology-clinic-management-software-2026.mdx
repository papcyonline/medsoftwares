## Why Cardiology Needs Specialized Software

### The Unique Challenges of Cardiovascular Practice

General-purpose EHR systems fail cardiologists because they lack:

- **Device integration:** ECG/EKG machines, Holter monitors, event recorders, stress systems, and hemodynamic monitors generate data that must flow seamlessly into the patient record
- **Structured cardiovascular reporting:** Echo, catheterization, and electrophysiology reports require highly structured templates with quantitative measurements, calculations, and standard terminology
- **Cardiac imaging management:** PACS systems for echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, CT angiography, and cardiac MRI with DICOM compliance
- **Remote cardiac monitoring:** Integration with implantable device interrogation (pacemakers, ICDs, loop recorders) and wearable heart monitors
- **Cardiovascular risk calculators:** Embedded risk scoring tools (ASCVD, CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, HEART score)
- **High-complexity billing:** Cardiac procedures involve complex coding with multiple components, modifiers, and global period management

### Market Context

- **Cardiovascular disease prevalence:** Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, with 700,000+ deaths annually in the US alone
- **Technology proliferation:** New devices and imaging modalities continuously expand the data management burden
- **Value-based cardiology:** Shift toward bundled payments for cardiac procedures (BPCI-A) and quality-based incentives
- **Remote monitoring growth:** RPM codes and wearable technology creating new care delivery and revenue models
- **Workforce pressure:** Cardiologist shortages driving demand for efficiency-enhancing technology
