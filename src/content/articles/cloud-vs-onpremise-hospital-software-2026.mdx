## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Cloud | On-Premise |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Upfront Cost** | Low | Higher |
| **Ongoing Cost** | Monthly fees | Lower after purchase |
| **Internet Required** | Yes (always) | No |
| **Data Location** | Vendor servers | Your servers |
| **IT Staff Needed** | Minimal | Some |
| **Scalability** | Easy | Hardware dependent |

## Understanding the Options

### Cloud-Based (SaaS)

**How It Works:**
- Software runs on vendor's servers
- Access via internet browser
- Vendor handles updates and maintenance
- Pay monthly or annually

**Example:** Most modern SaaS products

### On-Premise

**How It Works:**
- Software installed on your computers
- Data stored on your servers (or computers)
- You control updates
- One-time purchase or license

**Example:** HospitalOS, traditional enterprise software

### Hybrid

**How It Works:**
- Core system on-premise
- Some features cloud-connected
- Local data with optional sync
- Combines both models

**Example:** HospitalOS with cloud sync option

## When to Choose Cloud

### Cloud is Better When:

**1. You Have Reliable Internet**
- Consistent high-speed connection
- Minimal outages
- Adequate bandwidth for all users

**2. You Prefer OpEx Over CapEx**
- Can't make large upfront investment
- Prefer predictable monthly expenses
- Budget structure favors subscriptions

**3. You Have Limited IT Staff**
- No dedicated IT department
- Don't want to manage servers
- Prefer vendor-handled updates

**4. You Need Quick Deployment**
- Need to be operational fast
- No time for infrastructure setup
- Temporary or short-term need

### Cloud Challenges

**Internet Dependency:**
- No internet = no access
- Outages stop all work
- Slow connection = slow software

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Payments never end
- Prices increase over time
- Total cost exceeds purchase

**Data Control:**
- Your data on vendor servers
- Dependent on vendor security
- Potential access issues if vendor fails

---

## When to Choose On-Premise

### On-Premise is Better When:

**1. You Have Unreliable Internet**
- Frequent outages
- Slow or unstable connection
- Remote or rural location

**2. You Want Lower Long-Term Cost**

- Plan to use software 3+ years
- Want to own, not rent

**3. You Need Full Data Control**
- Regulatory requirements
- Security concerns
- Privacy priorities

**4. You Want Offline Capability**
- Must operate during outages
- Power/internet issues common
- Cannot afford downtime

### On-Premise Challenges

**Infrastructure Needs:**
- Need local computers/server
- Require basic IT knowledge
- Handle your own backups

**Update Management:**
- Install updates yourself
- Plan maintenance windows
- Track new versions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is cloud more secure than on-premise?

Not necessarily. Cloud vendors have security teams, but you trust them with your data. On-premise gives you full control. Both can be secure when properly managed.

### What happens if my cloud vendor goes out of business?

Your access could be disrupted or terminated. Data export may be difficult. This is a real risk—several healthcare SaaS vendors have shut down.

### Can on-premise software access the internet?

Yes, when needed. HospitalOS can sync data between locations and support remote access while still working fully offline.

### Is on-premise harder to set up?

Not with modern solutions. HospitalOS installs in hours, not weeks. It's designed for facilities without large IT teams.

### What about updates with on-premise?

HospitalOS provides free updates. You download and install at your convenience—no forced updates disrupting your workflow.

## Conclusion

**Cloud suits:** Facilities with reliable internet, monthly budget preference, and minimal IT staff.

**On-Premise suits:** Facilities needing offline capability, long-term cost savings, and data control.

**HospitalOS delivers:** On-premise benefits with modern browser interface, offline capability, and one-time pricing.

For most hospitals—especially in developing markets or areas with unreliable internet—**on-premise with HospitalOS** provides better value, reliability, and control.
