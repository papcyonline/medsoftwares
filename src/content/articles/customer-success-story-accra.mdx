Accra Central Pharmacy has been serving the community for over 20 years. When owner Kofi Mensah decided to modernize his operations with PharmaPOS, the results exceeded all expectations.

      ## The Challenge

      Before PharmaPOS, Accra Central faced several challenges:

      
        - Manual inventory tracking leading to stockouts and overstocking
        - Long checkout times frustrating customers
        - Difficulty tracking credit sales and collections
        - No visibility into sales trends or top-selling products
      

      ## The Solution

      After implementing PharmaPOS Standard package, the pharmacy saw immediate improvements:

      
        - **Checkout time reduced by 60%** with barcode scanning
        - **Inventory accuracy improved to 98%** from ~70%
        - **Credit collections improved by 45%** with automated reminders
        - **Overall sales increased by 40%** in the first year
      

      ## Owner Testimonial

      <blockquote>
        "PharmaPOS didn't just change how we work - it changed how we think about our business. Now I can see exactly what's happening and make better decisions. I wish I had done this years ago."
