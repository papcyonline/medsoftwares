Al Noor Polyclinic operates 5 specialty departments across a single facility in Dubai Healthcare City. With 12 physicians and over 300 patient visits daily, their disconnected departmental systems were creating billing delays, duplicate records, and compliance headaches with the Dubai Health Authority (DHA).

## Clinic Profile

- **Name**: Al Noor Polyclinic
- **Location**: Dubai Healthcare City, UAE
- **Type**: Multi-specialty polyclinic
- **Departments**: General Practice, Dermatology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Internal Medicine
- **Staff**: 42 (12 physicians, 15 nurses, 15 administrative/support)
- **Daily patient volume**: 300+ visits
- **Insurance partners**: 18 insurance providers

## The Challenge

Each department operated its own scheduling and record system — a mix of spreadsheets, a legacy desktop application, and paper charts:

- **Duplicate patient records**: 34% of patients had multiple records across departments
- **Insurance claim processing**: 4-6 weeks average, with 27% rejection rate
- **Appointment scheduling conflicts**: 8-12 double-bookings per week
- **DHA reporting**: Monthly compliance reports required 3 days of manual data compilation
- **Cross-department referrals**: Internal referrals took 24-48 hours due to paper-based communication
- **Revenue leakage**: Unbilled services estimated at AED 95,000 ($26,000) monthly

The DHA's increasing digitization requirements made modernization urgent — the clinic risked non-compliance penalties.

## Why They Chose HospitalOS

Al Noor evaluated four systems including two major international EMR vendors. HospitalOS won on:

1. **Unified patient record** — Single record across all departments and specialties
2. **DHA integration readiness** — Compliant with Dubai Health Authority electronic reporting
3. **Multi-insurance billing** — Handles 18 insurance providers with different claim formats
4. **Arabic and English interface** — Essential for their bilingual staff and patient population
5. **Cost structure** — One-time licensing versus competitors' per-physician monthly fees (saving AED 240,000 annually)

## Implementation

| Phase | Weeks | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 | Patient registration, unified records, appointment scheduling |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 | Billing, insurance claims, General Practice & Pediatrics |
| Phase 3 | 5-6 | Dermatology, Orthopedics, Internal Medicine modules |
| Phase 4 | 7-8 | DHA reporting, analytics, staff optimization |

Data migration from the legacy system was completed over a weekend to minimize disruption.

## Medical Director Testimonial

<blockquote>
"The insurance claim improvement was transformative. We were leaving AED 180,000 on the table every month due to coding errors and rejected claims. HospitalOS validates every claim against the insurer's requirements before submission. Our revenue recovery in the first 5 months covered the entire cost of implementation."

## Operations Manager Perspective

<blockquote>
"DHA compliance reporting used to consume three full days of my team's time every month. Now I generate the same reports in 15 minutes with a few clicks. The system automatically tracks the metrics DHA requires — we went from dreading audits to welcoming them because everything is documented and accessible."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Unified records eliminate costly duplication** — A single patient identity across departments prevents redundant tests and conflicting treatment plans
2. **Insurance claim automation drives immediate ROI** — The 78% reduction in rejections translates directly to revenue recovery
3. **Regulatory compliance becomes effortless** — Automated DHA reporting eliminated a major administrative burden
4. **One-time licensing saves significantly** — AED 240,000 annual savings compared to per-physician subscription models

## What's Next for Al Noor

The clinic is expanding to a second location in Abu Dhabi in Q3 2026 and will deploy HospitalOS from day one. They are also implementing the telemedicine module to serve patients across the Emirates.
