When HealthPlus Pharmacies expanded from 3 to 8 branches across Lagos, their paper-based inventory system collapsed under the weight. Stock discrepancies, long customer queues, and zero visibility across locations were costing them millions of naira every month.

## Company Profile

- **Name**: HealthPlus Pharmacies
- **Location**: Lagos, Nigeria (8 branches)
- **Type**: Multi-branch retail pharmacy chain
- **Staff**: 45 employees across all locations
- **Challenge**: Scaling operations across multiple branches with no centralized system

## The Challenge

Before PharmaPOS, HealthPlus faced critical operational failures:

- **Manual stock counts** took 2 full days per branch every month
- **Average checkout time** was 4.5 minutes per customer during peak hours
- **Stockouts** occurred on 12-15 essential medicines weekly across branches
- **No centralized reporting** — the owner drove between branches to collect paper reports
- **Expired medicine waste** averaged ₦380,000 ($250) per branch monthly
- **Mobile money payments** (OPay, PalmPay) were tracked in a separate notebook

The breaking point came when a stockout of pediatric antimalarials during rainy season cost the chain an estimated ₦2.8 million in lost sales over two weeks.

## Why They Chose PharmaPOS

HealthPlus evaluated three pharmacy systems before choosing PharmaPOS:

1. **Offline-first architecture** — Power outages in Lagos are daily; PharmaPOS works without internet
2. **Multi-branch central dashboard** — Real-time visibility across all 8 locations
3. **Mobile money integration** — OPay, PalmPay, and bank transfer tracking built in
4. **One-time license fee** — No monthly subscriptions eating into tight margins
5. **Naira pricing and local tax compliance** — Built for the Nigerian market

## Implementation

PharmaPOS was rolled out in phases over 3 weeks:

- **Week 1**: Headquarters and 2 highest-volume branches
- **Week 2**: 3 additional branches
- **Week 3**: Final 2 branches plus staff refresher training

Each branch required approximately 3 hours of staff training. The existing inventory was loaded via spreadsheet import, and barcode labels were printed for all products within the first week.

## Owner Testimonial

<blockquote>
"Before PharmaPOS, I was spending three days a week driving between branches just to understand what was happening. Now I open my laptop at home and see real-time sales, inventory levels, and alerts for all 8 locations. The system paid for itself in the first month from expired medicine savings alone."

## Staff Perspective

<blockquote>
"The barcode scanning changed everything. Customers used to wait while I searched for prices in a binder. Now it's scan, confirm, pay — done. Our regulars have noticed and they tell their friends."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Offline capability is non-negotiable in Lagos** — PharmaPOS processed over 400 transactions during a 3-day power outage with zero data loss
2. **Multi-branch visibility transforms decision-making** — Central dashboard eliminated weekly branch visits
3. **Mobile money integration captures lost revenue** — 31% of transactions now come through digital payments that were previously tracked on paper
4. **One-time pricing protects margins** — No monthly fees means the investment pays off faster for multi-location businesses

## What's Next for HealthPlus

HealthPlus plans to open 3 more branches in 2026 and will deploy PharmaPOS from day one at each location. They are also exploring the PharmaPOS API to integrate with their accounting software.
