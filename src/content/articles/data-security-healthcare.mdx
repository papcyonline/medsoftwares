As healthcare facilities digitize their operations, data security becomes increasingly critical. Patient data is sensitive and must be protected from unauthorized access, theft, and breaches.

      ## Why Healthcare Data is a Target

      Healthcare data is particularly valuable to cybercriminals because it contains:

      
        - Personal identification information
        - Financial and payment details
        - Medical history that can be used for fraud
        - Insurance information
      

      ## Essential Security Measures

      Every healthcare facility should implement these basic security measures:

      <ol>
        - **Strong passwords:** Require complex passwords and regular changes
        - **Access controls:** Limit data access based on job roles
        - **Encryption:** Encrypt data both in transit and at rest
        - **Regular backups:** Automated daily backups to secure locations
        - **Staff training:** Regular security awareness training
        - **Physical security:** Secure servers and workstations
      </ol>
