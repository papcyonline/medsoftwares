## Why Dermatology Practices Need Specialized Software

### The Visual Nature of Dermatology

**Photography Is Documentation:**
- Dermatology is the most visually oriented medical specialty
- Clinical photographs serve as critical diagnostic and medicolegal documentation
- Before-and-after imaging drives cosmetic patient satisfaction and marketing
- Serial photography tracks disease progression and treatment response

**High Procedure Volume:**
- Average dermatologist performs 30-50 procedures per day
- Biopsies, excisions, cryotherapy, Mohs surgery, laser treatments, and injectables
- Each procedure requires precise documentation of location, technique, and findings
- Pathology correlation is essential for biopsy specimens

**Mixed Revenue Streams:**
- Medical dermatology (insurance-based) and cosmetic dermatology (cash-based)
- Separate billing workflows for each revenue stream
- Product sales (skincare, sunscreen) alongside clinical services
- Package pricing for cosmetic treatment series
