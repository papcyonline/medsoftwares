Expired drugs represent one of the biggest preventable losses in pharmacy operations. In Africa, pharmacies lose an estimated 8-15% of inventory value to expiration annually. Automated expiry tracking software can cut this loss by 60% or more while ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance.

      ## The Cost of Expired Drugs

      For a pharmacy with $50,000 in inventory:

      
        - **At 10% expiry rate:** $5,000 annual loss
        - **With good software (2% rate):** $1,000 annual loss
        - **Annual savings:** $4,000
      

      This savings alone pays for software many times over!

      ## Why Drugs Expire in Pharmacies

      ### 1. Poor Visibility

      
        - Products buried in back of shelves
        - No systematic expiry checking
        - Relying on memory for soon-to-expire items
      

      ### 2. Incorrect Dispensing Order

      
        - Newer stock sold before older stock
        - No FEFO (First Expired, First Out) enforcement
        - Convenience-based picking
      

      ### 3. Overstocking

      
        - Buying too much to get volume discounts
        - Not considering shelf life in ordering
        - Slow-moving items accumulating
      

      ## How Expiry Tracking Software Works

      ### Batch-Level Tracking

      Every product entry includes:

      
        - Batch number from manufacturer
        - Manufacturing date
        - Expiry date
        - Quantity received
      

      ### Automated Alerts

      The system notifies you at configured intervals:

      
        - **6 months before:** Consider promotions or returns
        - **3 months before:** Prioritize in dispensing
        - **1 month before:** Urgent action needed
        - **Upon expiry:** Block from sale, flag for disposal
      

      ### FEFO Enforcement

      During sales, the system automatically:

      
        - Suggests earliest-expiring batch first
        - Warns if trying to sell newer stock
        - Tracks which batch was actually dispensed

      ## Best Practices for Expiry Management

      ### Receiving Stock

      
        - Check expiry dates before accepting delivery
        - Reject items with less than 6 months shelf life
        - Enter batch details immediately into system
        - Place new stock behind existing stock (FEFO)
      

      ### Ongoing Management

      
        - Review expiry report daily
        - Promote near-expiry items
        - Contact suppliers about returns
        - Rotate stock regularly
      

      ### When Items Expire

      
        - Remove from shelves immediately
        - Segregate in clearly marked area
        - Document for write-off
        - Follow proper disposal procedures
      

      ## Regulatory Compliance

        - Pharmacy Council inspections
        - Food and Drugs Authority (FDA)
