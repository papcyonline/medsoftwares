As of January 2026, approximately 80 different medications are experiencing shortages globally. Drug shortages have become a persistent challenge for pharmacies, affecting patient care and pharmacy operations. Modern pharmacy management software plays a crucial role in navigating these disruptions.

## The Growing Drug Shortage Crisis

Drug shortages have increased significantly over the past decade:

- **323 new shortages** reported in 2023 in the US alone
- **Average shortage duration**: 18 months
- **Most affected**: Generic injectables, cancer drugs, antibiotics
- **Root causes**: Manufacturing issues, supply chain disruptions, raw material shortages

### Impact on Pharmacies

Drug shortages create multiple challenges:

1. **Patient Care**: Delays in treatment, therapeutic substitutions
2. **Financial Impact**: Higher costs for alternatives
3. **Operational Burden**: Time spent finding alternatives
4. **Inventory Management**: Difficulty maintaining optimal stock
5. **Compliance Issues**: Documentation requirements increase

## How Software Helps Manage Drug Shortages

### 1. Real-Time Inventory Visibility

Modern pharmacy software provides instant visibility into:

- **Current Stock Levels**: Know exactly what's available
- **Days of Supply**: Calculate how long stock will last
- **Usage Trends**: Identify increasing demand early
- **Multi-Location View**: See inventory across all branches

[PharmaPOS](/pharmapos) offers real-time inventory dashboards showing stock levels across all locations with shortage alerts.

### 2. Alternative Drug Suggestions

Smart pharmacy systems suggest therapeutic alternatives:

**Automatic Alternative Matching:**
- Same drug class alternatives
- Equivalent therapeutic options
- Available manufacturer substitutes
- Generic equivalents

**Clinical Decision Support:**
- Drug interaction checking for alternatives
- Dosing conversion calculations
- Contraindication alerts
- Cost comparison data

### 3. Supplier Management Tools

Effective supplier management helps secure supply:

**Multi-Supplier Tracking:**
- Primary and backup suppliers
- Current availability status
- Lead time tracking
- Price comparisons

**Automated Reordering:**
- Reorder point calculations
- Split orders across suppliers
- Emergency order flagging
- Back-order tracking

### 4. Shortage Alerts and Notifications

Proactive alerting prevents stockouts:

- **FDA/ASHP Shortage Feed Integration**: Real-time shortage updates
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Before reaching critical levels
- **Expiry Warnings**: Prevent waste during shortages
- **Back-Order Status**: Track pending deliveries

### 5. Demand Forecasting

AI-powered forecasting helps anticipate needs:

- Historical usage analysis
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Trend identification
- Predictive stock recommendations

## Best Practices for Drug Shortage Management

### 1. Build Strategic Inventory Reserves

For critical medications, maintain safety stock:

| Drug Category | Recommended Safety Stock |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Life-Saving | 30-45 days supply |
| High-Volume | 14-21 days supply |
| Specialty | 21-30 days supply |
| Regular | 7-14 days supply |

### 2. Diversify Suppliers

Don't rely on a single source:

- Establish relationships with 2-3 wholesalers
- Consider direct manufacturer accounts
- Explore group purchasing organizations (GPOs)
- Maintain backup supplier credentials

### 3. Implement FIFO/FEFO Protocols

Reduce waste during shortages:

- **FIFO**: First In, First Out
- **FEFO**: First Expiry, First Out
- Automated expiry tracking
- Rotation alerts and reminders

### 4. Create a Shortage Response Team

Assign clear responsibilities:

- **Pharmacist Lead**: Clinical alternatives
- **Inventory Manager**: Sourcing and procurement
- **IT Support**: System configuration
- **Communication Lead**: Patient and prescriber notification

### 5. Document Everything

Maintain thorough records:

- Shortage notification dates
- Patient communications
- Therapeutic substitutions made
- Alternative sourcing attempts
- Cost impact tracking
