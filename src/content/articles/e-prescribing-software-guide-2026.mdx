E-prescribing (electronic prescribing) has become essential for modern healthcare. In 2026, 97% of pharmacy software reviewers rate e-prescribing as important or highly important. This guide explains everything you need to know about implementing digital prescription systems.

## What is E-Prescribing?

E-prescribing is the electronic generation, transmission, and filling of prescriptions, replacing traditional paper prescriptions. The prescriber sends the prescription directly to the patient's chosen pharmacy through a secure network.

### How E-Prescribing Works:

1. **Doctor creates prescription** in hospital/clinic software
2. **System checks** for drug interactions and allergies
3. **Prescription transmitted** electronically to pharmacy
4. **Pharmacy receives** and queues for dispensing
5. **Patient picks up** medication (no paper needed)

## Benefits of E-Prescribing Software
