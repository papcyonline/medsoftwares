Emergency departments face unprecedented pressure in 2026, with patient volumes rising, staffing shortages intensifying, and regulatory scrutiny increasing. Advanced ED management software has become essential for triaging patients efficiently, tracking ambulance arrivals, reducing wait times, and ensuring quality care under time-critical conditions. This guide covers emergency department software platforms, ambulance dispatch integration, and strategies for optimizing ED operations.
