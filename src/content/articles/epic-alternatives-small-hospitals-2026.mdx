Epic Systems dominates the hospital software market with a 35% market share among large hospitals. However, with implementation costs ranging from $500,000 to over $5 million, Epic is simply out of reach for small hospitals and clinics. This guide explores the best Epic alternatives that deliver comparable functionality at affordable prices.

      ## Why Small Hospitals Need Epic Alternatives

      Epic's pricing model makes it unsuitable for small healthcare facilities:

      
        - **Implementation Cost:** $500,000 to $5+ million
        - **Annual Maintenance:** 15-20% of initial cost yearly
        - **Implementation Time:** 12-24 months average
        - **Staff Requirements:** Dedicated IT team needed
        - **Minimum Size:** Generally requires 100+ beds
      

      Small hospitals with 10-50 beds need affordable alternatives that don't compromise on essential features.
