Today marks a significant milestone in MedSoftwares' journey. We are officially expanding our operations to East Africa, starting with Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.

      ## Why East Africa?

      East Africa represents one of the fastest-growing healthcare markets on the continent. With a combined population of over 150 million people and rapidly improving healthcare infrastructure, the region is primed for digital transformation.

      ## Local Presence

      We're not just selling software remotely. We're establishing local offices in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, and Kampala. This means:

      
        - Local support teams who understand your context
        - Training conducted in person by our experts
        - Faster response times for technical issues
        - Pricing in local currencies
      

      ## Localized Features

      Our software will be customized for East African markets, including integration with local payment systems like M-Pesa and Airtel Money, support for local tax regulations, and compatibility with national health insurance schemes.

      ## Launch Offer

      To celebrate our expansion, we're offering 20% off all packages for the first 100 customers in each country. Contact our sales team to learn more.
