## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is free hospital software really free?

The software itself may be free, but implementation, hosting, support, and maintenance add significant costs. Budget $15,000-$60,000+ for a "free" open-source deployment over 5 years.

### Can free software handle our compliance requirements?

Open source can be HIPAA-compliant, but YOU are responsible for ensuring compliance. This requires expertise and ongoing effort. Commercial solutions often include compliance features.

### How long does it take to implement free software?

Open source implementations typically take 3-6 months for basic functionality, longer for full deployment. Compare to 2-4 weeks for solutions like HospitalOS.

### What happens when something breaks?

With open source, you rely on community forums or paid consultants. Response times are unpredictable. Commercial solutions offer guaranteed support.

### Can we switch from free to commercial later?

Yes, data migration is possible but requires planning. Many hospitals that started with free software eventually switch to commercial solutions for reliability and support.

## Conclusion

"Free" hospital software is rarely truly free. Between implementation, hosting, support, and maintenance, open-source solutions often cost more than affordable commercial alternatives.

For most hospitals—especially those without dedicated IT development teams—**HospitalOS** provides better value:

- **Complete software** for $799-$4,999 one-time
- **2-4 week** implementation vs. 3-6 months
- **Support included** vs. expensive consultants
- **Works offline** for reliability
- **Updates forever** with no annual fees

The "free" path often leads to $30,000-$60,000 in costs. The smart path costs under $5,000.
