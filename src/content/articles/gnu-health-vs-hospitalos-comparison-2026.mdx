## Deployment and Setup

### GNU Health Deployment

GNU Health is built on the Tryton ERP framework, which uses Python and PostgreSQL. Deploying GNU Health in a production environment involves:

- **Server requirements**: Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu recommended) with Python 3, PostgreSQL, and Tryton server
- **Installation**: Command-line installation process with multiple dependencies
- **Configuration**: Hospital structure, departments, and clinical workflows must be manually configured
- **Concept setup**: ICD coding, drug databases, and lab test catalogs require population
- **Federation**: GNU Health Federation (MyGNUHealth) for personal health records requires additional setup
- **Technical expertise**: Strong Python and Linux administration skills required
- **Timeline**: 3-9 months for production deployment, depending on customization needs
- **Documentation**: Available but can be challenging for non-technical users

GNU Health has a steeper learning curve than many alternatives. The Tryton ERP foundation, while powerful, follows conventions that are unfamiliar to most healthcare IT staff.

## Public Health vs. Hospital Operations

This is the fundamental philosophical difference between the two platforms:

**GNU Health** was designed with a public health mission. It tracks social determinants of health, monitors disease outbreaks, manages vaccination campaigns, and generates epidemiological statistics. It is ideal for ministries of health, public health programs, and organizations focused on population health outcomes.

**HospitalOS** was designed for hospital operations. It manages patient flow from admission to discharge, handles pharmacy dispensing and stock management, processes billing and insurance claims, tracks bed availability, and generates financial reports. It is ideal for hospitals and clinics that need to run efficient daily operations.

If your primary mission is public health surveillance and epidemiology, GNU Health has a clear advantage. If your primary need is running a hospital or clinic efficiently, HospitalOS is purpose-built for that task.

## Best For

### Choose GNU Health If:

- You are a ministry of health or public health organization
- Disease surveillance and epidemiology are primary requirements
- Tracking social determinants of health is important to your mission
- You have Python/Tryton developers available
- You are willing to invest in a longer implementation timeline
- Your focus is population health rather than individual facility operations
- You value the UN/WHO endorsement for institutional credibility

### Choose HospitalOS If:

- You are running a hospital or clinic and need operational efficiency
- Your facility is in an area with unreliable internet connectivity
- Mobile money payment acceptance is important for your patients
- You need NHIS or insurance claims processing
- You want 24/7 professional support with guaranteed response times
- You need to go live quickly with minimal disruption
- You do not have Python developers or Tryton experts on staff
- You want predictable costs with a one-time license and no monthly fees

## Verdict

GNU Health is a unique and valuable contribution to global health informatics. Its focus on social medicine, public health surveillance, and health equity makes it an important tool for public health organizations and ministries of health. The UN and WHO endorsements reflect its alignment with global health priorities.

However, for individual hospitals and clinics that need to manage daily operations -- patient registration, pharmacy dispensing, billing, laboratory workflows, and financial reporting -- GNU Health's public health orientation can mean that practical hospital management features are less polished or require significant customization.

HospitalOS is built specifically for hospital and clinic operations in developing countries. Its offline-first architecture addresses the connectivity challenges that are a daily reality for many facilities. Mobile money integration, NHIS claims processing, and multi-currency support reflect an understanding of the practical needs that hospitals in these markets face every day. With 24/7 support and rapid deployment, [HospitalOS](/hospitalos) lets healthcare facilities focus on treating patients rather than managing software infrastructure.

## FAQ

### Is GNU Health really endorsed by the United Nations?

Yes. GNU Health has been recognized by the United Nations and the World Health Organization for its contribution to public health informatics. It is listed as a Digital Public Good by the Digital Public Goods Alliance. This endorsement reflects its value as a public health tool, particularly for disease surveillance and social medicine. However, UN endorsement does not necessarily mean it is the best fit for individual hospital operations.

### Can GNU Health work without internet like HospitalOS?

GNU Health has limited offline capabilities. The MyGNUHealth personal health record app can store some data locally, but the core hospital information system requires a connection to the Tryton server. HospitalOS was designed from the ground up as an offline-first system, meaning all modules -- clinical, pharmacy, billing, lab, and inventory -- function fully without internet and sync automatically when connectivity returns.

### Which system is better for a hospital in rural Africa?

For a rural hospital focused on daily clinical operations, HospitalOS is typically the better choice. It offers offline capability essential for areas with poor connectivity, mobile money integration that matches local payment habits, and professional support that does not require in-house technical expertise. GNU Health would be more appropriate if the facility is part of a national public health surveillance network and has access to technical implementation support.

### Can I use GNU Health for pharmacy management?

GNU Health includes basic medication management and stock tracking through the Tryton framework. However, it does not offer the depth of pharmacy management found in a dedicated system like HospitalOS, which includes drug interaction checking, expiry tracking, batch management, controlled substance monitoring, and automated reorder alerts. If pharmacy management is a critical need, HospitalOS provides significantly more comprehensive functionality.

### How do the two systems compare for generating government health reports?

GNU Health has strong built-in support for public health reporting, disease notifications, and epidemiological statistics that align with WHO reporting requirements. HospitalOS focuses more on operational and financial reporting -- patient volume, revenue, department performance, and NHIS claims. Some facilities use GNU Health at the ministry level for aggregated public health data while individual hospitals use operational systems like HospitalOS for day-to-day management.
