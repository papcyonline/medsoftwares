Healthcare generates massive amounts of data—but data alone doesn't improve care. The healthcare analytics market is projected to reach $156 billion by 2034, as hospitals recognize that turning data into actionable insights is essential for quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability.

## Why Healthcare Analytics Matters

### The Data Explosion

Modern hospitals generate enormous data volumes:

- **EHR records**: Patient histories, diagnoses, treatments
- **Clinical systems**: Lab results, imaging, vitals
- **Operational data**: Scheduling, staffing, supplies
- **Financial data**: Claims, payments, costs
- **Patient feedback**: Surveys, reviews, complaints

### The Analytics Imperative

Without analytics, this data sits unused. With analytics:

| Challenge | Analytics Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Quality variation | Standardized outcome tracking |
| Cost overruns | Resource utilization insights |
| Patient safety | Risk prediction and alerts |
| Revenue leakage | Billing and coding optimization |
| Staffing issues | Demand forecasting |

## Types of Healthcare Analytics
