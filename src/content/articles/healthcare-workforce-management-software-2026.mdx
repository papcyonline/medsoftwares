## How Healthcare Workforce Management Software Works

### Workflow Example: Filling an Open Shift

1. **Shift becomes open** -- Nurse calls out sick for tomorrow's 7a-7p ICU shift
2. **System identifies qualified staff** -- Software filters nurses with ICU competency, valid credentials, no overtime conflicts, and within rest requirements
3. **Automated notifications sent** -- Push notifications to eligible nurses via mobile app
4. **Shift bidding opens** -- Qualified nurses can claim the shift (first-come or seniority-based)
5. **If unfilled** -- Escalation to float pool, then internal premium pay, then agency
6. **Manager dashboard updates** -- Real-time visibility into fill status
7. **Shift confirmed** -- Selected nurse receives confirmation, schedule updates automatically
8. **Payroll updated** -- Premium pay, differential, or overtime automatically calculated

### Workflow Example: Monthly Schedule Creation

1. **Demand forecast generated** -- Historical census data predicts staffing needs
2. **Template applied** -- Base schedule template with rotation patterns loaded
3. **Self-scheduling window opens** -- Staff select preferred shifts (7-14 day window)
4. **Algorithm optimizes** -- Software balances preferences against coverage requirements
5. **Manager reviews** -- Dashboard shows gaps, conflicts, and compliance issues
6. **Adjustments made** -- Manager fills remaining gaps, resolves conflicts
7. **Schedule published** -- Staff notified via app, changes tracked going forward
8. **Open shift marketplace** -- Remaining unfilled shifts posted for pickup
