**Reminder Content:**

### Strategy 2: Overbooking Strategy

Strategic overbooking for high no-show slots:

- Have contingency for all-show days

### Strategy 3: Deposit/Prepayment

For high no-show services:

- Reduces no-shows by 30-50%

### Strategy 4: Same-Day Confirmation

### Strategy 5: No-Show Policies

Implement and enforce policies:

- Third no-show: Require deposit
- Communicate policy clearly at booking

## Optimizing Physician Schedules

### Time Slot Optimization:

**Traditional Approach:**
- Fixed 15-minute slots
- One appointment per slot
- Rigid schedule

**Optimized Approach:**
- Variable slot lengths by visit type
- Buffer time for complex cases
- Catch-up slots every 2 hours
- Admin time blocks

### Provider Productivity Tips:

- **Cluster similar appointments:** Group physicals, follow-ups
- **Batch paperwork time:** Dedicated slots for documentation
- **Buffer after complex cases:** Prevent cascade delays
- **Protected lunch breaks:** Physician wellness matters

### Template Best Practices:

**Morning Schedule:**
- 8:00-8:30: New patients (need more time)
- 8:30-11:30: Mix of follow-ups and new
- 11:30-12:00: Buffer/catch-up

**Afternoon Schedule:**
- 1:00-1:30: New patient
- 1:30-4:30: Follow-ups
- 4:30-5:00: Same-day urgent slots
