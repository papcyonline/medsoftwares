      ## When to Choose Each System

      ### Choose Epic When:

      
        - You're a large health system with 500+ beds
        - You need advanced analytics and population health tools
        - Budget is not a primary concern
        - You're in a market where Epic dominance aids interoperability
        - You need deep integration with other Epic facilities
      

      ### Choose Cerner (Oracle Health) When:

      
        - You're a mid-to-large hospital wanting cloud-first approach
        - Oracle ecosystem integration is valuable
        - You want government/VA experience and compliance
        - Budget is significant but slightly below Epic requirements
      

      ### Choose MEDITECH When:

      
        - You're a community hospital with moderate budget
        - You want established vendor with long track record
        - Rural or community hospital setting
        - US or Canadian market focus
      

      ### Choose HospitalOS When:

      
        - Budget is a primary consideration
        - You need offline capability (unreliable internet)
        - You're located outside North America/Europe
        - You want to avoid vendor lock-in and long contracts
        - You need rapid implementation (weeks, not years)
        - You're a small to medium hospital (10-200 beds)
        - You need multi-currency or multi-language support
      

      ## Implementation Reality Check

      ### Epic/Cerner Implementation Challenges

      
        - **Timeline:** Typically 12-24 months from contract to go-live
        - **Staff Impact:** Significant productivity loss during transition
        - **Change Management:** Major organizational change required
        - **Cost Overruns:** Common to exceed initial budget by 20-50%
        - **Customization:** Each customization adds cost and complexity
      

      ### HospitalOS Implementation Reality

      
        - **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks typical implementation
        - **Staff Impact:** Minimal disruption, intuitive interface
        - **Training:** Most staff productive within 1-2 days
        - **Cost:** Fixed price, no surprises
        - **Support:** 24/7 support included from day one
      

      ## The Interoperability Question

      A common concern with alternatives is interoperability. Here's the reality:

      ### HospitalOS Interoperability

      
        - **HL7 Support:** Full HL7 v2.x messaging for lab, ADT, orders
        - **FHIR Ready:** FHIR R4 API support for modern integrations
        - **Lab Integration:** Connect with external laboratories
