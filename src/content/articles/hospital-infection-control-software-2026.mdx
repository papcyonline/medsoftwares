## Core Features of Infection Control Software

### HAI Surveillance

The foundation of any **infection surveillance system** is comprehensive, real-time monitoring:

**Automated Case Detection:**
- **Lab result integration** — automatic flagging of positive cultures and sensitivity results
- **Clinical criteria application** — system evaluates NHSN definitions against patient data
- **Denominator calculation** — automated tracking of device days, patient days, and procedure counts
- **Risk stratification** — adjusting rates based on patient acuity, unit type, and procedure complexity
- **Trend analysis** — statistical process control charts identifying rate changes over time

**Surveillance Workflow:**
1. Lab system detects positive culture and sends result to IPC software
2. System evaluates result against NHSN surveillance definitions
3. Alert generated for infection preventionist (IP) review
4. IP reviews clinical data and confirms or rules out HAI
5. Confirmed HAI is classified and attributed to appropriate unit/procedure
6. Data feeds into dashboards, reports, and NHSN submission

**Surveillance Dashboard Metrics:**
- **Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR)** — observed vs. expected infections
- **Device utilization ratios** — central line, urinary catheter, and ventilator utilization
- **Infection rates by unit, organism, and time period**
- **Antimicrobial resistance patterns** tracked over time
- **Benchmark comparisons** against national and peer group data

### Antibiogram Tracking

The **antibiogram** is a critical tool for guiding empiric antibiotic therapy:

- **Automated antibiogram generation** from lab data with annual and cumulative views
- **Organism-specific susceptibility tracking** for all tested antibiotics
- **Unit-level antibiograms** showing resistance patterns specific to ICU, wards, and outpatient areas
- **Trend analysis** detecting emerging resistance patterns before they become outbreaks
- **Guideline integration** linking antibiogram data to empiric therapy recommendations
- **CLSI compliance** ensuring susceptibility testing follows current standards
- **Custom report generation** for pharmacy, infectious disease, and medical staff committees

### Hand Hygiene Monitoring

**Hand hygiene compliance** is the single most effective measure for preventing HAIs:

**Monitoring Methods:**

| Method | Accuracy | Cost | Scalability | Hawthorne Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct Observation** | Gold standard | Low (staff time) | Limited | High |
| **Electronic Monitoring (Badge-based)** | High | High (infrastructure) | Excellent | Low |
| **Video Monitoring with AI** | High | Moderate | Good | Moderate |
| **Product Usage Tracking** | Moderate (indirect) | Low | Excellent | None |
| **Self-Reporting** | Low | Very low | Excellent | N/A |

**Best Practices for Hand Hygiene Programs:**
- Combine multiple monitoring methods for comprehensive measurement
- Set department-specific compliance targets (typically 80-95%)
- Provide real-time feedback to healthcare workers at the point of care
- Track compliance by role (physician, nurse, technician, environmental services)
- Link compliance data to infection rate outcomes for motivation
- Integrate with recognition programs rewarding high-compliance units

- **Molecular epidemiology integration** linking whole-genome sequencing data to epidemiologic findings
- **Automated cluster alerts** triggered when case counts exceed statistical thresholds

**Outbreak Response Workflow:**
1. System detects cluster through automated surveillance algorithms
2. Alert sent to infection prevention team with case details and line listing
3. IP team initiates investigation — confirms cases, identifies commonalities
4. Environmental assessment and enhanced screening implemented
5. Interventions deployed (enhanced cleaning, isolation, screening cultures)
6. System tracks ongoing cases to determine if outbreak is controlled
7. After-action report generated with lessons learned and process improvements

**Outbreak Management Tools:**
- **Line listing generator** compiling all relevant case data in standardized format
