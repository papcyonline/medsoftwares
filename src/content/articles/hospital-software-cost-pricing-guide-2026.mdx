## Understanding Pricing Models

### Model 1: One-Time License

**How it works:** Pay once, own forever

**Example: HospitalOS**

| Edition | One-Time Cost | Annual Cost | 5-Year Total |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Clinic | $799 | $0 | $799 |
| Standard | $1,499 | $0 | $1,499 |
| Professional | $2,499 | $0 | $2,499 |
| Enterprise | $4,999 | $0 | $4,999 |

**Pros:**
- Predictable total cost
- No ongoing payments

- Lower long-term cost

**Cons:**
- Higher upfront investment
- May need to pay for major upgrades

**Best for:** Budget-conscious hospitals, developing markets

### Model 2: Monthly/Annual Subscription (SaaS)

**How it works:** Pay monthly or annually for access

**Example Pricing:**

| Vendor | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | 5-Year Total |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Small SaaS | $200-$500/month | $2,400-$6,000 | $12,000-$30,000 |

### Model 3: Per-User/Per-Provider Pricing

| Basic EMR | $50-$100 | $6,000-$12,000 | $30,000-$60,000 |
