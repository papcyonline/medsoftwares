Monthly software fees drain hospital budgets year after year. A $500/month system costs $30,000 over 5 years—and you never own anything. There's a better way: one-time payment hospital software that you own forever.

## The Problem with Monthly Fees

### The Never-Ending Payment Cycle

| Monthly Cost | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Year 10 |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| $300/month | $3,600 | $10,800 | $18,000 | $36,000 |
| $500/month | $6,000 | $18,000 | $30,000 | $60,000 |
| $1,000/month | $12,000 | $36,000 | $60,000 | $120,000 |
| $2,000/month | $24,000 | $72,000 | $120,000 | $240,000 |

**And you never own the software.**

### Other Subscription Problems

**1. Price Increases**
- Annual increases of 3-10%
- No control over future costs
- Budget unpredictability

**2. Vendor Lock-In**
- Data held hostage
- Difficult to switch
- Dependent on vendor survival

**3. Feature Restrictions**
- Basic tiers limit features
- Pressure to upgrade
- Nickel-and-diming

**4. Internet Dependency**
- No internet = no software
- Cloud outages stop work
- Data access concerns
