## Common RFP Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Requirements

**Problem:** "We need good billing software."

**Better:** "We need billing software that processes 500+ daily transactions, integrates with NHIS, and provides aging reports."

### Mistake 2: Unrealistic Timelines

**Problem:** Expecting full implementation in 2 weeks.

**Reality:** Allow adequate time for quality implementation (typically 4-12 weeks depending on scope).

### Mistake 3: Focusing Only on Price

**Problem:** Selecting cheapest option without considering total value.

**Better:** Evaluate total cost of ownership including support, training, and long-term fees.

### Mistake 4: Too Many Must-Haves

**Problem:** Making everything "required" eliminates good options.

**Better:** Distinguish truly required features from desired features.

### Mistake 5: Skipping References

**Problem:** Trusting vendor claims without verification.

**Better:** Always check references from similar hospitals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should the RFP process take?

Typically 8-12 weeks from RFP release to final selection. Don't rush—good selection prevents expensive mistakes.

### How many vendors should we invite?

3-6 vendors is ideal. Too few limits options; too many overwhelms evaluation.

### Should we include pricing in evaluation criteria?

Yes, but balance with functionality and quality. The cheapest option isn't always the best value.

### What if no vendor meets all requirements?

Prioritize requirements. Consider which gaps are acceptable vs. which are dealbreakers.

### Can we negotiate after RFP selection?

Yes, negotiation is expected. Use competitive tension to negotiate better terms.
