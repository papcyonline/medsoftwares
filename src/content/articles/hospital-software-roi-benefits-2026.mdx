## Where ROI Comes From

### 1. Staff Efficiency Gains

**Time Savings:**

| Task | Manual Time | With HMS | Time Saved |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Patient registration | 15-20 min | 3-5 min | 75% |
| Finding records | 10-15 min | 30 sec | 97% |
| Appointment scheduling | 10 min | 2 min | 80% |
| Billing preparation | 30 min | 5 min | 83% |
| Report generation | 2-4 hours | 5 min | 97% |

**Financial Impact:**
- Average nurse hourly rate: $35-$50
- Average admin hourly rate: $20-$30
- 2 hours saved per staff per day = $15,000-$25,000/year per FTE

**Example Calculation:**
- 20 clinical staff × 1.5 hours saved/day × $40/hour × 250 days
- = **$300,000 annual staff efficiency savings**

### 2. Revenue Cycle Improvements

**Billing Accuracy:**

| Metric | Before HMS | After HMS | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Clean claim rate | 70-80% | 92-98% | 15-25% |
| Days in A/R | 45-60 days | 25-35 days | 40% faster |
| Denial rate | 10-15% | 3-5% | 70% reduction |
| Revenue captured | 85-90% | 95-99% | 5-10% increase |

**Financial Impact:**
- 5% revenue increase on $5M annual billing = $250,000
- Faster collections improve cash flow
- Reduced write-offs increase profitability

### 3. Inventory Optimization

**Medication & Supply Savings:**

| Overstock | 20-30% extra | 5-10% buffer | 15-20% |
| Expiration losses | 5-10% | Under 2% | 5-8% |

**Example Calculation:**
- Annual inventory spend: $500,000
- 15% reduction through optimization
- = **$75,000 annual inventory savings**
