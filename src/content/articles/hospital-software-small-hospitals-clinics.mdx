Small hospitals and clinics face unique challenges when implementing hospital management software. Budget constraints, limited IT staff, and simpler workflows require solutions tailored to their specific needs rather than complex enterprise systems.

      ## Who is This Guide For?

      
        - Small private hospitals (10-50 beds)
