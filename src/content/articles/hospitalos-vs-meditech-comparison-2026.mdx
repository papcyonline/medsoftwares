MEDITECH has been a cornerstone of hospital IT for over 50 years, serving more than 2,300 healthcare organizations. But its enterprise pricing and US-centric design leave many hospitals — especially mid-size facilities and those in emerging markets — looking for alternatives. This guide compares HospitalOS and MEDITECH across every dimension that matters in 2026.

## Pricing Comparison

### HospitalOS Pricing

- **Model**: One-time license fee
- **Starting Price**: Based on facility size
- **Multi-Facility**: Discounted per additional site
- **Updates**: Free lifetime updates
- **Support**: Included in license
- **Infrastructure**: Runs on standard hardware

**5-Year Total Cost (100-bed hospital)**: ~$2,000-5,000

### MEDITECH Pricing

- **Model**: Annual licensing + implementation
- **Implementation**: $500,000-2,000,000+ (varies by modules)
- **Annual Fees**: $100,000-300,000+

**5-Year Total Cost (100-bed hospital)**: ~$500,000-1,500,000+

### Cost Analysis

The pricing gap between HospitalOS and MEDITECH is substantial. A 100-bed hospital saves approximately **$500,000-1,500,000 over 5 years** by choosing HospitalOS. This makes MEDITECH impractical for most hospitals outside wealthy healthcare systems.

## Conclusion

MEDITECH Expanse is a powerful, mature hospital information system with advanced clinical features, deep US regulatory compliance, and decades of refinement. For well-funded US and Canadian hospitals, it remains a strong choice.
