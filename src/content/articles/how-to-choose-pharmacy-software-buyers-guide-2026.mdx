## Step 4: Create Your Vendor Shortlist

### Research Sources

1. **Industry publications** - Pharmacy Times, Drug Topics
2. **Review sites** - Capterra, G2, TrustRadius

## Step 9: Measure Success

| Inventory accuracy | | | |
| Claim rejection rate | | | |
| Staff overtime hours | | | |
| Customer complaints | | | |

### ROI Calculation

**Time Savings:**
- Hours saved per week × hourly cost = weekly savings
- Weekly savings × 52 = annual savings

**Error Reduction:**
- Errors prevented × cost per error = annual savings

**Inventory Optimization:**
- Reduced waste + better turns = annual savings

**Total ROI:**
- Annual savings ÷ total investment = ROI percentage

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based on Price Alone

**The problem:** Cheapest option often lacks features or support you need.

**Instead:** Calculate total cost of ownership including lost productivity from missing features.

### Mistake 2: Not Testing with Real Workflows

**The problem:** Demo scenarios don't match your actual work.

**Instead:** Bring real prescriptions and scenarios to test during demos.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Staff Input

**The problem:** Staff who use it daily weren't consulted.

**Instead:** Include pharmacists and technicians in evaluation.

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Implementation Time

**The problem:** Rushed implementations cause problems.

**Instead:** Plan adequate time and don't rush go-live.

### Mistake 5: Not Planning for Growth

**The problem:** Software can't scale with your business.

**Instead:** Choose software that supports your 5-year vision.
