Starting a pharmacy is exciting but complex. Your pharmacy management software is the backbone of operations—choose wrong and you'll struggle from day one. This guide walks you through everything you need to know about setting up pharmacy software for a new business.

## Before You Choose Software

### 1. Define Your Pharmacy Type

Different pharmacy types have different software needs:

| Pharmacy Type | Key Software Needs |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Independent Retail | POS, inventory, prescriptions |
| Chain/Multi-Branch | Central management, reporting |
| Hospital Outpatient | Integration with hospital systems |
| Specialty | Prior auth, specialty workflows |
| Compounding | Formulation tracking |
| Long-Term Care | Facility management, cycle fills |

### 2. Assess Your Market

Consider your location's requirements:

- **Regulatory compliance** (FDA, state board, DRAP, NMRA, etc.)
- **Insurance systems** (commercial, Medicaid, NHIS, etc.)
- **Payment preferences** (cash, mobile money, cards)
- **Language needs** (local language support)
- **Internet reliability** (offline capability?)

### 3. Set Your Budget

Software costs vary widely:

| Pricing Model | Typical Cost | 5-Year Total |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| One-Time License | $300-$3,000 | $300-$3,000 |
| Monthly Subscription | $200-$500/mo | $12,000-$30,000 |

**Recommendation**: For new pharmacies, one-time licensing preserves capital for other startup costs.
