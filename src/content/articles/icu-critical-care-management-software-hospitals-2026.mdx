Intensive Care Units (ICUs) represent the highest acuity, most resource-intensive areas of hospitals, where sophisticated software systems are essential for coordinating complex care, monitoring critically ill patients, and optimizing limited bed capacity. In 2026, ICU management software has evolved from basic census tracking to comprehensive clinical decision support platforms integrating with medical devices, automating documentation, and using AI to predict patient deterioration. This guide covers ICU software platforms, critical care workflows, device integration strategies, and improving outcomes while managing costs.
