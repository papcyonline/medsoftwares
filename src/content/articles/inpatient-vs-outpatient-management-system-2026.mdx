## Understanding Inpatient (IPD) Management Systems

### What is an Inpatient Management System?

An **inpatient management system** (also called IPD module, ADT system, or hospital ward management) handles all workflows related to patients who are formally admitted to the hospital and occupy a bed. These patients require continuous care, monitoring, and documentation throughout their stay.

### Core IPD Workflows

**1. Admission Management**

The admission process is the gateway to inpatient care:

- **Pre-admission:** Insurance verification, pre-authorization, pre-operative testing
- **Emergency admission:** Rapid bed assignment from ED, trauma protocols
- **Scheduled admission:** Planned surgical or medical admissions
- **Direct admission:** Physician-ordered admission bypassing ED
- **Transfer admission:** Patient arriving from another facility

**Admission Data Captured:**
- Patient demographics and emergency contacts
- **Insurance and pre-authorization** details
- Admitting diagnosis (ICD-10)
- Attending physician assignment
- Level of care (ICU, step-down, med-surg, telemetry, rehab)
- Advance directives and code status
- Allergies and medication reconciliation
- Isolation precautions

**2. Bed Management**

Bed management is the heart of IPD operations:

- **Real-time bed board:** Visual display of all beds by unit, showing occupied, available, dirty, blocked, reserved
- **Bed assignment logic:** Matching patient acuity to appropriate unit and bed type
- **Isolation management:** Negative pressure rooms, contact/droplet/airborne precautions
- **Bed turnaround tracking:** Time from discharge to clean to ready for next patient
- **Capacity alerts:** Census thresholds triggering diversion or discharge push protocols

**Bed Types Managed:**
- ICU beds (medical, surgical, cardiac, neuro, pediatric)
- **Step-down/progressive care** beds
- Medical-surgical beds
- Telemetry beds
- Labor and delivery beds
- Pediatric beds
- Psychiatric beds
- Rehabilitation beds
- Private vs. semi-private rooms

**3. Nursing Documentation (Inpatient)**

Inpatient nursing documentation is extensive and continuous:

- **Nursing assessments:** Head-to-toe assessments every shift (or more frequently)
- **Vital signs:** Scheduled q4h, q2h, q1h, or continuous monitoring
- **Intake and output (I&O):** Fluid balance tracking (IV fluids, oral intake, urine, drains)
- **Medication administration record (MAR):** Documenting every medication given with time and route
- **Pain assessments:** Regular pain scoring and intervention documentation
- **Fall risk assessments:** Morse Fall Scale or similar, updated each shift
- **Skin assessments:** Braden Scale for pressure injury risk
- **Care plans:** Individualized nursing care plans with goals and interventions
- **Restraint documentation:** If applicable, required monitoring at defined intervals

**4. Physician Orders (Inpatient)**

- **Admission order sets:** Standardized orders for common diagnoses (CHF, pneumonia, hip replacement)
- **Medication orders:** Scheduled, PRN, and one-time medications with dosing parameters
- **Laboratory orders:** Stat, routine, and recurring lab tests
- **Imaging orders:** X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound
- **Dietary orders:** NPO, clear liquids, regular, therapeutic diets
- **Activity orders:** Bed rest, ambulate with assistance, physical therapy
- **Nursing orders:** Vital sign frequency, I&O, wound care, foley care
- **Consult orders:** Specialty consultations

**5. Discharge Management**

Discharge is a complex, multi-step process:

- **Discharge planning:** Begins at admission, coordinated by case management
- **Discharge orders:** Physician writes discharge medications, instructions, follow-up
- **Medication reconciliation:** Comparing admission meds to discharge meds
- **Patient education:** Discharge instructions, medication teaching, warning signs
- **Follow-up scheduling:** Post-discharge appointments booked before patient leaves
- **Disposition:** Home, skilled nursing facility, rehab, long-term care, hospice, AMA
- **Discharge summary:** Dictated or templated summary of stay for PCP and specialists

## Understanding Outpatient (OPD) Management Systems

### What is an Outpatient Management System?

An **outpatient management system** (also called OPD module, clinic management system, or ambulatory care software) handles workflows for patients who visit for scheduled or walk-in appointments and leave the same day. These encounters are typically shorter, more focused, and follow a different documentation and billing pattern.

### Core OPD Workflows

**1. Appointment Scheduling**

Appointment management is the backbone of OPD:

- **Online booking:** Patient self-scheduling through web portal or mobile app
- **Phone scheduling:** Staff-assisted appointment booking
- **Walk-in management:** Same-day visits without prior appointment
- **Recurring appointments:** Follow-up series (weekly physical therapy, monthly chronic care)
- **Multi-provider scheduling:** Coordinating visits across specialists in a single trip
- **Resource scheduling:** Rooms, equipment, procedures requiring specific resources
- **Automated reminders:** SMS, email, and phone reminders reducing no-shows

**2. Queue Management**

OPD replaces bed management with queue management:

- **Check-in kiosks:** Patient self-check-in with demographics verification
- **Digital queue display:** Waiting room screens showing queue position (by number, not name for privacy)
- **Token system:** Numbered tokens for walk-in clinics
- **Estimated wait times:** Dynamic calculation based on current queue and provider pace
- **Priority queuing:** Urgent cases, elderly, pregnant, and VIP fast-track
- **Multi-queue support:** Different queues for registration, vitals, doctor, lab, pharmacy, billing
- **Real-time status tracking:** Staff dashboard showing patient journey through the visit

**3. Clinical Documentation (Outpatient)**

Outpatient documentation focuses on the encounter:

- **SOAP notes:** Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan format
- **Chief complaint and HPI:** Focused history of present illness
- **Review of systems:** Targeted rather than comprehensive
- **Physical exam:** Focused exam relevant to chief complaint
- **Assessment and diagnosis:** ICD-10 coding at the encounter level
- **Plan:** Medications prescribed, labs ordered, imaging ordered, referrals, follow-up instructions
- **Procedure notes:** If minor procedures performed (skin biopsy, injection, wound care)
- **Visit summary:** Printed or electronic summary for patient at check-out

**4. Prescription Management (Outpatient)**

Unlike inpatient MAR, outpatient focuses on prescriptions:

- **E-prescribing:** Electronic prescription sent directly to patient's pharmacy
- **Medication list management:** Current medication review and update
- **Drug interaction checking:** Real-time alerts for contraindications
- **Formulary checking:** Insurance formulary verification for coverage
- **Refill management:** Prescription refill requests from patients and pharmacies
- **Prior authorization:** Electronic submission for medications requiring approval

**5. Referral Management**

Outpatient systems handle the referral lifecycle:

- **Internal referrals:** PCP to specialist within the same organization
- **External referrals:** To outside specialists, labs, imaging centers
- **Referral tracking:** Status monitoring (sent, received, scheduled, completed)
- **Referral authorization:** Insurance pre-authorization management
- **Report receipt:** Tracking consultant reports and results
- **Closed-loop communication:** Ensuring referring provider receives findings

## Integrated IPD + OPD Systems: The Ideal Architecture

### Why Integration Matters

Separate IPD and OPD systems create dangerous information silos:

- **Duplicate patient records** across systems
- **Lost clinical information** when patients transition between settings
- **Billing errors** from incorrect patient status classification
- **Medication reconciliation gaps** between inpatient and outpatient
- **Provider frustration** from logging into multiple systems

### Benefits of a Unified Platform

An integrated system like **[HospitalOS](/hospitalos)** provides:

- **Single patient record** across all care settings
- **Seamless transitions:** ED to inpatient to outpatient follow-up without data loss
- **Unified medication list:** Inpatient MAR and outpatient prescriptions in one view
- **Cross-setting scheduling:** Book outpatient follow-up before inpatient discharge
- **Consolidated billing:** IPD and OPD claims from one revenue cycle platform
- **Unified reporting:** Analytics across all care settings for population health

### Workflow Example: Patient Journey Through Integrated System

1. **OPD Visit:** Patient sees PCP for chest pain, referred to cardiologist
2. **OPD Specialist:** Cardiologist orders stress test, finds abnormality
3. **Scheduled IPD Admission:** Patient admitted for cardiac catheterization
4. **IPD Stay:** Cath lab procedure, 2-day recovery, nursing documentation
5. **IPD Discharge:** Medications reconciled, follow-up scheduled
6. **OPD Follow-Up:** Cardiologist reviews results, adjusts medications
7. **Ongoing OPD:** Chronic disease management with regular visits

In an integrated system, **every step shares the same patient chart**, with full visibility into medications, labs, imaging, and clinical notes across all settings.
