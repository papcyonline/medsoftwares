A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is essential for modern hospital laboratories. It automates workflows, reduces errors, and improves turnaround times for test results.

      ## What is a LIMS?

      A LIMS manages laboratory operations including:

      
        - Sample registration and tracking
        - Test ordering and workflow
        - Result entry and validation
        - Report generation
        - Quality control
        - Inventory management
        - Billing integration
      

      ## Benefits of LIMS
