Medical equipment is the backbone of modern healthcare delivery, and keeping it operational, calibrated, and compliant is a massive undertaking. In 2026, hospitals manage thousands of assets -- from MRI machines worth millions to infusion pumps numbering in the hundreds -- all requiring rigorous **preventive maintenance**, calibration, and documentation. A specialized **Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS)** designed for healthcare has become essential for biomedical engineering departments, facilities teams, and hospital administrators aiming to maximize equipment uptime, minimize costs, and satisfy regulatory requirements from the Joint Commission and CMS.
