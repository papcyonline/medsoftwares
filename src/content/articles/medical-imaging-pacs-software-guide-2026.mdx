Medical imaging generates more data than any other department in a hospital. A single CT scan can produce over 1,000 images, and a busy radiology department may process hundreds of studies daily. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Radiology Information Systems (RIS) have become indispensable for managing this enormous volume of diagnostic images. In 2026, the landscape has shifted dramatically with cloud-native platforms, AI-assisted interpretation, vendor neutral archives, and teleradiology reshaping how medical images are stored, viewed, shared, and analyzed. This guide covers everything you need to know about PACS and medical imaging software.

## Understanding PACS, RIS, and Related Systems

### What Is PACS?

**Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)** is a medical imaging technology that provides economical storage and convenient access to diagnostic images from multiple modalities. A PACS consists of four major components:

1. **Image acquisition** -- Digital connections to imaging modalities (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound)
2. **Communication network** -- DICOM-based network for image transmission
3. **Archive** -- Short-term and long-term image storage (on-premise or cloud)
4. **Display workstations** -- Diagnostic-quality monitors with specialized viewing software

### What Is RIS?

**Radiology Information System (RIS)** manages the administrative and business side of radiology operations:

- Order management and scheduling
- Patient tracking and workflow coordination
- Report generation and distribution
- Billing and coding
- Quality metrics and analytics

### What Is a VNA?

**Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA)** is a medical image archiving solution that stores images in a standard format (DICOM) independent of the PACS vendor:

- Eliminates vendor lock-in for image storage
- Centralizes images from multiple PACS across a health system
- Supports non-DICOM content (photos, PDFs, videos)
- Enables long-term archiving with data migration flexibility

### The PACS Ecosystem

```
Modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, US) → DICOM Network → PACS Server → Viewing Workstations

                                        RIS (Orders, Scheduling, Reports)
                                                       ↕
                                        VNA (Long-term Archive)
                                                       ↕
                                        EHR (Clinical Integration)

## DICOM Standards: The Foundation of Medical Imaging

### What Is DICOM?

**Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)** is the international standard for transmitting, storing, retrieving, printing, processing, and displaying medical imaging information.

**Key DICOM Concepts:**

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **DICOM Object** | Image file with embedded metadata | CT slice with patient demographics, study info |
| **DICOM Service** | Communication protocol between devices | Store (C-STORE), Query (C-FIND), Retrieve (C-MOVE) |
| **Modality Worklist** | Automated patient/study info to modalities | MWL pre-fills patient data on the scanner |
| **Structured Report** | Machine-readable clinical findings | AI detection results, measurements |
| **DICOM Web** | RESTful API for web-based image access | Browser-based PACS viewers |

### DICOM Compliance Requirements

**For PACS vendors:**
- Full DICOM 3.0 conformance with published conformance statement
- Support for all relevant DICOM services (Store, Query/Retrieve, Print, Worklist)
- Proper handling of DICOM metadata (patient demographics, study information)

**For healthcare facilities:**
- DICOM network configuration and security
- Modality configuration for proper DICOM routing
- DICOM data migration planning for system transitions
- Compliance with IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) profiles
