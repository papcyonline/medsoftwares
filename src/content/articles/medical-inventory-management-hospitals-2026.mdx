## Why Medical Inventory Management Matters

### The Hidden Cost Problem

Hospitals typically spend 30-40% of their operating budget on supplies and equipment. Poor inventory management leads to:

- **Stockouts**: Critical items unavailable when needed
- **Overstocking**: Capital tied up in excess inventory
- **Expiration Waste**: Products expiring before use
- **Emergency Ordering**: Premium pricing for rush deliveries
- **Staff Time**: Hours spent searching for or ordering supplies

### Patient Safety Impact

Inventory issues directly affect patient care:

- Delayed procedures due to missing supplies
- Medication errors from disorganized storage
- Expired products reaching patients
- Infection risks from supply compromises
- Care variation from product substitutions
