Medication Therapy Management (MTM) represents one of the most significant revenue and patient care opportunities for pharmacies in 2026. With Medicare Part D MTM programs, commercial payer initiatives, and expanded clinical pharmacy services, MTM software platforms have become essential tools for delivering, documenting, and billing comprehensive medication reviews. This guide covers everything you need to know about MTM software, CMS requirements, top platforms, and strategies for building a profitable clinical pharmacy practice.

## What is Medication Therapy Management (MTM)?

Medication Therapy Management is a distinct service or group of services provided by pharmacists to optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. MTM services are independent of, but can occur in conjunction with, the provision of a medication product.

### Core MTM Services

**Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR):**
- Systematic review of all patient medications (prescription, OTC, herbals, supplements)
- Identification of medication-related problems
- Development of Personal Medication Record (PMR)
- Creation of Medication Action Plan (MAP)

**Targeted Medication Reviews (TMRs):**
- Focused interventions for specific drug therapy problems
- Adherence assessments and interventions
- Cost-saving opportunities identification

**Additional Clinical Services:**
- Immunization coordination and administration
- Disease state management (diabetes, hypertension, asthma)
- Medication synchronization programs
- Transitions of care services

### MTM Market Size and Growth

The medication therapy management market is experiencing robust growth driven by:

- **Aging Population:** 77 million baby boomers requiring complex medication regimens
- **Chronic Disease Prevalence:** 60% of adults have at least one chronic condition
