OPD (Outpatient Department) and IPD (Inpatient Department) are the two primary patient care settings in hospitals. Effective software management of both is essential for quality care and operational efficiency.

        - Visit for consultation only
        - Don't require overnight stay
        - Need minor procedures
        - Require follow-up care
