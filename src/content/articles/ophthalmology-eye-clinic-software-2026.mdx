## The Eye Care Software Market in 2026

### Why Eye Care Needs Specialized Software

General medical EHR systems cannot adequately serve eye care practices because of:

- **Unique exam workflows:** Eye exams involve refraction, slit lamp, dilated fundus examination, tonometry, and specialized testing that general templates cannot capture efficiently
- **Diagnostic imaging volume:** OCT, visual fields, fundus photography, corneal topography, and other imaging modalities require DICOM integration and image management
- **Dual revenue streams:** Eye care combines medical services (insurance-billed) with retail optical sales (out-of-pocket), requiring integrated but separate systems
- **Surgical complexity:** Cataract surgery, LASIK, glaucoma procedures, and retinal surgery demand pre-operative assessments, IOL calculations, surgical planning, and post-operative tracking
- **Optical dispensing:** Frame and contact lens inventory management with point-of-sale functionality
- **High patient volume:** Many eye clinics see 40-60+ patients daily, requiring extremely efficient documentation

### Market Dynamics

- **Aging population:** Cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration prevalence increasing with aging demographics
- **Technology advancement:** New imaging modalities (OCTA, widefield imaging, AI-assisted screening) require software adaptation
- **Private equity consolidation:** Large eye care groups demanding enterprise-level software capabilities
- **Teleoptometry growth:** Remote refraction and virtual consultations expanding access to care
- **Value-based care:** Quality reporting and outcome measurement becoming reimbursement requirements
