MedSoftwares is proud to announce a strategic partnership with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) of Ghana to streamline insurance claims processing for pharmacies.

      ## What This Means for Pharmacies

      Starting January 2025, PharmaPOS users in Ghana will be able to:

      
        - Verify patient insurance status in real-time
        - Submit claims electronically directly from the POS
        - Track claim status and receive payment notifications
        - Generate compliance reports automatically
      

      ## Reducing Administrative Burden

      Currently, pharmacies spend an average of 15 hours per week on insurance paperwork. Our integration is expected to reduce this to under 2 hours, freeing staff to focus on patient care.

      ## Faster Payments

      Electronic claims processing will reduce the average reimbursement time from 45 days to under 14 days, improving cash flow for pharmacies.

      ## Getting Started

      The integration will be available as a free update for all PharmaPOS users in Ghana. Training sessions will be conducted throughout December 2024.
