## Overcoming Common Engagement Barriers

### Digital Literacy Challenges

Not all patients are comfortable with technology. Address this by:

- Offering **in-person enrollment assistance** during check-in

- **Audio content** for patients with reading difficulties
- **Cultural sensitivity** in health education materials

### Provider Adoption

Patient engagement tools only work when providers actively participate:

- **Integrate messaging into existing clinical workflows** rather than creating separate tasks

## How to Choose the Right Patient Engagement Platform

### Evaluation Criteria

When selecting a **patient experience platform**, prioritize these factors:

1. **EHR Integration Depth**: Does the platform integrate natively with your EHR or require middleware?
2. **Mobile Experience**: Is there a dedicated mobile app, and is it well-rated by patients?
3. **Customization**: Can you brand the portal, customize workflows, and add organization-specific content?
4. **Scalability**: Will the platform grow with your organization from one location to many?
5. **Analytics**: Does the platform provide actionable insights, not just raw data?
6. **Support**: What level of technical support and customer success resources are included?
7. **Security**: Does the platform meet all HIPAA requirements with documented compliance?
8. **Cost**: What is the total cost including implementation, per-patient fees, and messaging costs?

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Platforms that require patients to create accounts with separate credentials (SSO is preferred)
- Vendors without a published HIPAA compliance framework
- Systems with no mobile-responsive design or dedicated app
- Platforms that do not support bidirectional EHR data flow
- Vendors who cannot provide references from similar-sized healthcare organizations
