      <div class="warning-box">
        **Important:** Many international software solutions are cloud-only and won't function during load shedding. Choose solutions with proven offline capability.

        - Assess current medical aid integration requirements

        - Consider BEE requirements for software vendors
      

      ### Training Requirements

      
        - Pharmacist-specific workflows
