The global pharmacy management software market is projected to exceed **$10 billion by 2025**, with inventory management being a critical driver. Pharmacies using modern inventory software see a **15% reduction in operational costs**, and AI-powered systems can reduce stockouts by **40%** and expired medications by **25%**.

      This guide covers best practices and software solutions for pharmacy inventory management in 2026.

      ## The Cost of Poor Inventory Management

      ### Common Problems

      
        - **Stockouts:** Lost sales and patient dissatisfaction
        - **Overstocking:** Tied-up capital and storage costs
        - **Expired Medications:** Direct financial loss and disposal costs
        - **Manual Errors:** Incorrect counts and ordering mistakes
        - **Regulatory Issues:** Compliance failures with batch tracking
      

      ### Impact Statistics

      
        - Drug costs represent **40-50%** of healthcare operational costs
        - Pharmacies lose **2-5%** of inventory value to expiry annually
        - Stockouts cause **10-15%** of customers to switch pharmacies
      

      ## Best Practices for Inventory Management

      ### 1. Implement FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

      Ensure oldest stock is dispensed first to minimize expiry:

      
        - Label medications clearly with expiration dates
        - Arrange shelves so oldest stock is at front
        - Use software that enforces FIFO during dispensing
        - Regular shelf rotation during restocking
      

      ### 2. Set Intelligent Reorder Points

      Establish reorder points based on:

      
        - Historical prescription trends
        - Supplier lead times
        - Safety stock requirements
        - Seasonal demand variations
      

      ### 3. Analyze Prescription Trends

      
        - Track which medications are most frequently prescribed
        - Identify seasonal variations (flu season, allergy season)
        - Monitor new prescriptions vs. refills
        - Adjust inventory based on local health trends
      

      ### 4. Implement Surplus Exchange

      Trade surplus medications with other pharmacies before they expire:

      
        - Reduces waste across pharmacy networks
        - Recovers value from slow-moving inventory
        - Helps other pharmacies avoid stockouts

      ### AI-Powered Features

      
        - **Demand Forecasting:** Predict future needs based on trends
        - **Automatic Optimization:** Adjust reorder points dynamically
        - **Substitute SKU Linking:** Suggest alternatives for stockouts
