Inventory management is the backbone of pharmacy profitability. Poor stock control leads to expired drugs, stockouts, tied-up capital, and lost customers. Effective [pharmacy inventory management software](/pharmapos/inventory) can reduce waste by 40-60%, improve cash flow, and ensure you always have what patients need. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about [pharmacy inventory software](/solutions/pharmacy-software) in 2026.

      ## The Cost of Poor Inventory Management

      Before exploring solutions, understand what poor inventory management actually costs:

      
        - **Expired Stock:** Average pharmacy loses 2-5% of inventory value to expiry annually
        - **Stockouts:** Each stockout loses the sale AND potentially the customer forever
        - **Overstocking:** Ties up cash that could be used for profitable products
        - **Theft/Shrinkage:** Without tracking, losses go undetected
        - **Manual Errors:** Paper-based systems lead to counting mistakes
      

      <div class="info-box">
        **Industry Stat:** Pharmacies using automated inventory management report 30-50% reduction in expired product waste and 20% improvement in inventory turnover.
