Drug expiry is one of the biggest profit killers for pharmacies. Without proper tracking, pharmacies lose 3-8% of inventory value annually to expired medications. Modern pharmacy inventory software with expiry tracking solves this problem.

      ## The Cost of Expired Drugs

      
        - **Direct loss:** Cost of expired products written off
        - **Disposal costs:** Proper pharmaceutical waste disposal
        - **Regulatory risk:** Fines for selling expired medications
        - **Reputation damage:** Customer trust issues
        - **Typical loss:** 3-8% of annual inventory value
      

      ## How Expiry Tracking Software Works

      ### 1. Entry at Receipt

      
        - Record expiry date when receiving stock
        - Batch number tracking
        - Manufacturer information
        - Barcode linking for quick lookup
      

      ### 2. Automatic Monitoring

      
        - Continuous expiry date checking
        - Configurable alert thresholds
        - Dashboard visibility of at-risk stock
        - Daily/weekly expiry reports
      

      ### 3. FIFO Enforcement

      
        - First In, First Out selling
        - System prompts oldest stock first
        - Prevents newer stock selling before older
        - Reduces expiry likelihood
      

      ### 4. Alerts and Actions

      
        - 90-day alerts: Plan return to supplier
        - 60-day alerts: Consider discounting
        - 30-day alerts: Urgent action needed
        - Expired: Block from sale

      ## ROI of Expiry Tracking

        - **Before:** 5% annual expiry loss = $30,000/year
        - **After:** 1% expiry loss = $6,000/year
        - **Savings:** $24,000/year
        - **PharmaPOS cost:** $999 one-time
