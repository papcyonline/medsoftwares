A pharmacy Point of Sale (POS) system is the backbone of modern pharmacy operations. In Africa, where unique challenges like power outages, connectivity issues, and mobile money payments exist, choosing the right POS is critical for success.

      ## What is a Pharmacy POS System?

      A pharmacy POS system is specialized software and hardware that handles:

      
        - Sales transactions and payment processing
        - Inventory tracking and management
        - Customer records and prescriptions
        - Receipt generation and printing
        - Sales reporting and analytics
        - Integration with accounting systems
      

      ## Why African Pharmacies Need Specialized POS

      ### Unique African Challenges

      
        - **Power Instability:** Systems must handle outages gracefully
        - **Internet Reliability:** Offline operation is essential
        - **Mobile Money:** MTN MoMo, M-Pesa, Airtel Money are primary payment methods
        - **Multi-Currency:** Some regions deal in multiple currencies
        - **NHIS Integration:** Insurance claim processing requirements
      

      ### Generic POS Limitations

      Standard retail POS systems fail pharmacies because they lack:

      
        - Drug-specific inventory features (expiry dates, batch numbers)
        - Prescription tracking and controlled substance management
        - NHIS/insurance claim processing
        - Pharmacy regulatory compliance features

      ### 3. Drug Expiry Management

      
        - Track expiry dates for all products
        - FIFO enforcement (sell oldest first)
        - Automatic expiry alerts
        - Expiring stock reports
      

      ### 4. Fast Checkout

      
        - Barcode scanning for speed
        - Quick product search
