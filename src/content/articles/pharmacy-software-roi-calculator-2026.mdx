## ROI Calculation Framework

### Basic ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
```

### Example Calculation

**Pharmacy Profile:**
- 150 prescriptions/day
- 3 staff members
- $500,000 annual revenue

**Costs (One-Time License):**
- Software: $2,000
- Hardware: $1,500
- Training: $500
- Implementation: $500
- **Total Investment: $4,500**

**Annual Benefits:**
- Labor savings: $10,875
- Reduced errors: $5,700
- Inventory optimization: $24,100
- Increased sales: $8,000
- Insurance improvements: $1,800
- **Total Annual Benefits: $50,475**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Year 1 ROI = ($50,475 - $4,500) / $4,500 × 100 = 1,022%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
$4,500 / $50,475 × 12 months = 1.1 months
```
