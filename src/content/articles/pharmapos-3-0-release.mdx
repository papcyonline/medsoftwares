We are thrilled to announce the release of PharmaPOS 3.0, our most significant update yet. This release represents months of development work and direct feedback from our customers across Africa.

      ## AI-Powered Inventory Predictions

      The standout feature of this release is our new AI-powered inventory prediction system. By analyzing your historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and market trends, PharmaPOS 3.0 can now:

      
        - Predict which products will run low before they do
        - Suggest optimal reorder quantities to minimize waste
        - Identify slow-moving inventory that may expire
        - Alert you to unusual sales patterns that may indicate issues
      

      ## Enhanced Mobile Money Integration

      We've expanded our mobile money integration to support even more providers across Africa. New additions include Wave, Orange Money, and Airtel Money, joining our existing support for MTN MoMo, Vodafone Cash, and M-Pesa.

      ## Improved User Interface

      Based on user feedback, we've redesigned several key screens to be more intuitive and faster to use. The new sales screen reduces checkout time by up to 30% compared to previous versions.

      ## How to Update

      Existing customers will receive the update automatically over the next two weeks. If you'd like to update immediately, please contact our support team. New customers will receive PharmaPOS 3.0 by default with all new installations.
