      ## Feature Comparison

      

      ## Pricing Comparison

      ### PharmaPOS Pricing (Transparent)

      
      **Support:** 3 months free, then $29/month optional

      ### Computer-Rx Pricing (Opaque)

      
        - Custom quotes required - not publicly disclosed

        - User feedback: "the cost is high" and "costs more than its competitors"
      

      ### 3-Year Total Cost Comparison

      

      ## Customer Support Comparison

      ### PharmaPOS Support

      
        - 3 months free support with purchase
        - Optional $29/month continued support
        - Direct, responsive support team
        - Remote training included
        - On-site training available (Standard+)
      

      ### Computer-Rx Support (User Feedback)

      Support quality is the **most common complaint** in user reviews:

      <blockquote>
        "Horrible customer service - if your pharmacy is down you better shut down for the day"

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        "Can't get anyone to answer the phone"

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        "Taking 6 months to reply to critical tickets"

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        "Over a 12 year period I watched/experienced a great system erode to a terrible system"

      </blockquote>

      ### Support Verdict

      **PharmaPOS wins** on support responsiveness. Computer-Rx's multiple ownership changes (GTCR → BlackRock → Cardinal Health merger) have reportedly degraded service quality.

      ## Software Stability

      ### PharmaPOS

      
        - Desktop application with offline-first architecture
        - Works during internet outages
        - Local data storage - you own your data
        - Stable ownership with consistent updates
      

      ### Computer-Rx

      User feedback on stability:

      
        - "Constant restarts and issues from the beginning"
        - "The program is riddled with bugs"
        - "At the time, the software was great and the company was privately owned. Today, neither is true"
