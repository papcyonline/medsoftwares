## Why Rehab Clinics Need Specialized Software

### Limitations of General EHR Systems

Standard medical EHR systems fail rehabilitation clinics in several critical ways:

- **No therapy-specific documentation:** General systems lack SOAP note templates designed for physical, occupational, and speech therapy
- **No exercise prescription tools:** Cannot create, customize, and deliver home exercise programs (HEPs) with video demonstrations
- **Inadequate outcome tracking:** Missing standardized functional outcome measures (FOTO, OPTIMAL, Oswestry)
- **Poor scheduling flexibility:** Cannot handle therapy-specific scheduling patterns (30-, 45-, 60-minute slots, concurrent patients, group therapy)
- **Limited billing support:** Lack therapy-specific billing rules (8-minute rule, modifier tracking, timed vs. untimed codes)
- **No productivity tracking:** Cannot monitor therapist units per visit, cancellation rates, or arrival rates

### The Financial Imperative

Rehabilitation practices operate on tight margins, making software-driven efficiency critical:

| Metric | Industry Benchmark | Software Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Cancellation rate** | &lt;10% | Automated reminders reduce by 30-50% |
| **Units per visit** | 3.5-4.5 | Documentation prompts maximize capture |
| **Days in A/R** | &lt;35 days | Claim scrubbing reduces denials |
| **Authorization denials** | &lt;5% | Tracking prevents expired authorizations |
| **Patient retention** | >80% completion | HEP engagement improves adherence |
| **Therapist productivity** | 85-90% utilization | Smart scheduling optimizes caseload |

## How to Choose the Right Physiotherapy Software

### Step 1: Define Your Clinic Profile

- **Discipline mix:** PT only, or PT + OT + SLP?
- **Practice setting:** Outpatient private practice, hospital-based, home health, or hybrid?
- **Clinic size:** Solo practitioner, small group (2-5 therapists), or multi-site enterprise?
- **Patient volume:** Average daily visits per therapist?
- **Payer mix:** Insurance-dominant, cash-pay, workers' comp, or mixed?
- **Geography:** US-based (insurance billing critical) or international (cash-pay common)?

### Step 2: Rank Your Feature Priorities

| Feature | Solo PT | Group Practice | Hospital Outpatient |
|---|---|---|---|
| SOAP notes | Critical | Critical | Critical |
| Exercise library / HEP | Critical | Critical | Important |
| Insurance billing | Critical | Critical | Integrated with hospital |
| Scheduling | Important | Critical | Critical |
| Outcome tracking | Important | Critical | Critical |
| Patient portal | Important | Critical | Important |
| Multi-site management | N/A | Critical | Critical |
| Analytics / reporting | Basic | Advanced | Advanced |
| EHR integration | N/A | N/A | Critical |

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost of Ownership

**Per-visit pricing example (WebPT):**
- 30 visits/day x 250 days/year x $3/visit = $22,500/year per clinic

**Per-provider pricing example (Prompt):**
- 5 therapists x $150/month x 12 months = $9,000/year

**One-time license example ([HospitalOS](/hospitalos)):**
- One-time investment with no recurring license fees
- Annual support and updates at a fraction of subscription costs

### Step 4: Evaluate Integration Needs

- **Existing hospital EHR:** Does the therapy software integrate with Epic, Cerner, or your current system?
- **Billing clearinghouse:** Is your preferred clearinghouse supported?
- **Exercise library:** Can you import custom exercises and protocols?
- **Patient engagement tools:** Does the portal meet your patients' expectations?
- **Outcome registries:** Can you submit data to FOTO, OPTIMAL, or AAOS registries?
