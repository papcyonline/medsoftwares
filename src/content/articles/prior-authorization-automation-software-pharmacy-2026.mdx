Prior authorization has become the single largest barrier to timely medication access in 2026, with 85%+ of specialty medications and 35% of all prescriptions requiring PA. Manual PA processes consume 15-20 hours per week of pharmacy staff time, delay patient care by days or weeks, and result in 20-30% prescription abandonment. Prior authorization automation software is transforming this broken process, reducing PA completion time from days to hours while improving approval rates.

## The Prior Authorization Crisis

### By the Numbers

**Prevalence:**
- 85%+ of specialty prescriptions require PA
- 35% of all prescriptions affected by PA
- 10-15 PAs per day for average community pharmacy
- Growing annually as payers expand PA requirements

**Time Burden:**
- Average manual PA: 60-90 minutes per case
- Pharmacy staff time: 15-20 hours/week on PAs
- Physician office time: 14 hours/week per provider
- Total U.S. healthcare PA time: $31 billion annually

**Patient Impact:**
- Average PA approval time: 2-7 days (manual)
- 1 in 4 patients never start therapy due to PA delays
- 20-30% prescription abandonment rate
- Disease progression during PA delays
- Emergency department visits for untreated conditions

**Denial Rates:**
- Initial PA denial rate: 20-30%
- Eventual approval after appeals: 75-85%
- Unnecessary clinical burden from denials

## ROI of PA Automation

### Time Savings

**Manual PA Process:**
- 60-90 minutes per PA (calls, faxes, forms, follow-ups)
- 10 PAs/day × 75 minutes = 12.5 hours/day
- At $20/hour pharmacy staff cost = $250/day

**Automated PA Process:**
- 10-20 minutes per PA (data entry, electronic submission, monitoring)
- 10 PAs/day × 15 minutes = 2.5 hours/day
- **Time saved: 10 hours/day** = $200/day savings
- **Annual savings: $50,000+**

### Revenue Protection

**Reduced Prescription Abandonment:**
- Manual PA abandonment rate: 25-30%
- Automated PA abandonment rate: 10-15%
- For 10 PAs/day average value $300 each
- Abandonment reduction: 3 prescriptions/day × $300 × 250 days = **$225,000 annual revenue protection**

**Faster Approval:**
- Manual PA approval: 3-7 days average
- Automated PA approval: 1-2 days average
- Faster therapy initiation = better adherence and refills

### Patient Outcomes

**Clinical Benefits:**
