Pharmacy inventory waste silently drains profits. Expiring medications, overstocking, and poor tracking can cost pharmacies 15-25% of inventory value annually. Here's how to cut that waste dramatically.

## The True Cost of Inventory Waste

### Where Waste Happens

| Waste Type | Typical Loss | Preventable? |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Expired medications | 5-10% of inventory | 90%+ |
| Overstocking | 10-20% excess inventory | 80%+ |
| Theft/shrinkage | 1-3% of inventory | 70%+ |
| Damaged goods | 1-2% of inventory | 60%+ |
| Obsolete stock | 2-5% of inventory | 85%+ |

### Financial Impact

**Example: $200,000 Annual Inventory**

| Waste Category | Rate | Annual Loss |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| Expiration | 8% | $16,000 |
| Overstocking (tied capital) | 15% | $30,000 |
| Shrinkage | 2% | $4,000 |
| **Total Waste** | | **$50,000** |

**With proper management, you can recover $20,000-$40,000 annually.**

## Strategy 1: Expiration Management

### The Problem

Medications expire on shelves because:
- No systematic tracking
- Poor rotation (FEFO)
- Ordering too much
- Hidden stock in storage

### The Solution

**Implement Expiration Tracking Software:**

PharmaPOS tracks every item's expiration date and alerts you automatically.

| Alert Type | Timing | Action |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Early warning | 6 months before | Consider promotions |
| Action alert | 3 months before | Prioritize dispensing |
| Urgent alert | 1 month before | Return/discount/dispose |
| Expired alert | On expiration | Remove from inventory |

**Best Practices:**

1. **Enter expiration dates on receipt** — Every item, every time
2. **Use FEFO** — First Expired, First Out
3. **Regular audits** — Monthly expiration checks
4. **Negotiate returns** — Work with suppliers on near-expiry items
5. **Discount near-expiry** — Better to sell cheap than waste

### Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Expiration loss | 8% | 2% | 75% reduction |
| Near-expiry sales | 10% | 60% | 6x increase |
| Return credits | $500/yr | $3,000/yr | 6x increase |

## Strategy 2: Smart Reordering

### The Problem

Manual ordering leads to:
- Ordering too much (ties up cash)
- Ordering too little (lost sales)
- Inconsistent stock levels
- Emergency orders (higher costs)

### The Solution

**Automated Reorder Points:**

PharmaPOS calculates optimal reorder points based on:
- Historical sales velocity
- Lead time from suppliers
- Safety stock requirements
- Seasonal variations

| Parameter | Manual Guess | Software Calculated |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Reorder point | "When it looks low" | 15 units (based on data) |
| Order quantity | "A few boxes" | 42 units (EOQ formula) |
| Safety stock | Unknown | 8 units |
| Accuracy | 50% | 95%+ |

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Set up product categories
2. Configure lead times by supplier
3. Review historical sales data
4. Set reorder points and quantities
5. Enable automatic alerts
6. Review and adjust monthly

### Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Stockouts | 5/week | 1/month | 95% reduction |
| Overstock | 20% excess | 5% buffer | 75% reduction |
| Emergency orders | 10/month | 1/month | 90% reduction |
| Carrying costs | High | Optimized | 30% reduction |

## Strategy 3: ABC Analysis

### The Problem

Treating all inventory equally wastes management effort:
- High-value items under-monitored
- Low-value items over-managed
- Stockouts on critical items
- Overstocking on slow movers

### The Solution

**Categorize Inventory by Value:**

| Category | % of Items | % of Value | Management Level |
|----------|------------|------------|------------------|
| A Items | 10-20% | 70-80% | Tight control, frequent review |
| B Items | 20-30% | 15-20% | Moderate control, monthly review |
| C Items | 50-70% | 5-10% | Simple control, quarterly review |

**PharmaPOS ABC Features:**
- Automatic categorization
- Category-specific reorder rules
- Focused reporting
- Alert prioritization

**Management by Category:**

| Category | Reorder Frequency | Safety Stock | Review Cycle |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| A | As needed (often) | Higher | Weekly |
| B | Regular schedule | Moderate | Monthly |
| C | Bulk ordering | Lower | Quarterly |

## Strategy 4: Supplier Management

### The Problem

Poor supplier relationships cause:
- No returns for expiring stock
- Higher prices
- Long lead times
- Inconsistent supply

### The Solution

**Optimize Supplier Relationships:**

| Strategy | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Negotiate return policies | Reduce expiration losses |
| Consolidate orders | Volume discounts |
| Track lead times | Better reorder points |
| Multiple suppliers | Reduce stockout risk |
| Payment terms | Improve cash flow |

**PharmaPOS Supplier Features:**
- Supplier performance tracking
- Lead time monitoring
- Price comparison
- Purchase history
- Return tracking

### Negotiation Tips

**For Returns:**
- Ask about near-expiry return policies
- Request extended return windows
- Negotiate credit vs. replacement

**For Pricing:**
- Commit to volumes for discounts
- Ask about prompt payment discounts
- Compare across suppliers

## Strategy 5: Cycle Counting

### The Problem

Annual inventory counts:
- Disrupt operations
- Find problems too late
- Miss ongoing shrinkage
- Inaccurate between counts

### The Solution

**Continuous Cycle Counting:**

Count a portion of inventory regularly instead of everything annually.

| Approach | Frequency | Coverage |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| A items | Weekly | All A items monthly |
| B items | Bi-weekly | All B items monthly |
| C items | Monthly | All C items quarterly |

**PharmaPOS Cycle Count Features:**
- Automatic count scheduling
- Variance tracking
- Adjustment logging
- Discrepancy alerts

### Implementation

1. Generate count list (by category)
2. Count physical inventory
3. Enter counts in system
4. Review variances
5. Investigate discrepancies
6. Adjust if verified
7. Document findings

## Strategy 6: Storage Optimization

### The Problem

Poor storage leads to:
- Damaged medications
- Hidden expired stock
- Inefficient picking
- Temperature issues

### The Solution

**Storage Best Practices:**

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Organized shelving | Faster picking, less damage |
| FEFO arrangement | Earlier expiration in front |
| Climate control | Prevent temperature damage |
| Clear labeling | Reduce picking errors |
| Regular cleaning | Identify issues early |

**Layout Recommendations:**
- Fast movers at eye level, easy access
- Slow movers on lower/higher shelves
- Refrigerated items properly stored
- Controlled substances secured
