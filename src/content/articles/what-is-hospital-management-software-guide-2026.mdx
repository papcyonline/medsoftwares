## What is Hospital Management Software?

**Hospital Management Software (HMS)** is an integrated information system designed to manage all aspects of a hospital's operations, including:

- Patient care and medical records
- Administrative functions
- Financial operations
- Inventory and supplies
- Staff management
- Reporting and analytics

Think of HMS as the central nervous system of a hospital—connecting all departments and functions into one cohesive workflow.

## How Does HMS Work?

### The Core Concept

HMS connects different hospital departments through a shared database:

```
Patient Registration → OPD/IPD → Lab/Radiology → Pharmacy → Billing
         ↓               ↓           ↓              ↓          ↓
    [Central Database - All Information Connected]
```

### Example Patient Journey

**Without HMS (Manual):**
1. Patient fills paper form at reception
2. Paper file created, carried to doctor
3. Doctor writes on paper, sends patient to lab
4. Lab results written, patient returns
5. Prescription written on paper
6. Patient goes to pharmacy
7. Separate billing calculation
8. Patient pays, paper receipt

**With HMS (Digital):**
1. Receptionist enters patient info once
2. Doctor sees patient history instantly
3. Lab order placed digitally
4. Results appear automatically
5. e-Prescription sent to pharmacy
6. Bill calculated automatically
7. Patient pays, electronic receipt
8. Complete record saved

**Time saved: 50-70%**
